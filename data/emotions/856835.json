As the day was fine, and the wind fair, we determined on visiting Reggio, eight miles distant, on the opposite shore of Calabria; we embarked accordingly in a small boat, and soon found ourselves in the middle of the ter rible and far-famed Charybdis. It is now called Galofaro but under ordinary circumstances is nothing more than eddy and slight surf caused by the meeting of the main and lateral currents. It is not always in the same situation, shifting according to the state of the tide,\u201c but it is generally most vio\u00ac lent when opposite the angle of the Braccio di S. Rainiere, on which the lighthouse stands. In passing through it the boat was turned considerably from its course, so that for a moment we lost the wind out of the sail, and were obliged to use the oars.

In an hour and a quarter we reached Reggio, and were carried before the commandant, who examined our passports, and then told us we were at liberty to proceed wherever we wished. The town has a most melancholy and ruinous ap- pearance, many of the houses being cracked and split in every direction, while the walls of others lie in confused heaps on the ground, precisely as they were left by the earthquake of the ground, precisely as they were left by the earthquake of 1783.

Considerable numbers of the peasantry are employed in the management of silk-worms, the houses for which purpose may be observed at each side of the road. The windows are long and narrow, too much air being considered prejudicial to the in- sects in their first state, and they are closed completely, and slow fires lighted in the houses, when the eggs are on the point of being hatched. As soon as this operation has taken place the worms are placed on shelves, formed of reeds, and fed with mulberry leaves ; those from the black mulberry are pre- ferred, from the circumstance of its coming into leaf late in the season, at which period the worms are not so liable to be the season, at which period the worms are not so liable to be destroyed by any vicissitude of weather, as they would be were they hatched at the time that the white mulberry shows its leaves. It is also maintained by the Reggians that worms fed on the black mulberry produce silk which is heavier, and of a superior quality to any other; but the silk-workers of Bergamo, and the south of France, are of a contrary opinion; and the question seems to have been set at rest by the experiments made at Montpellier, the result of which has been a decided preference for the leaves of the white mulberry. In case of a blight attacking the mulberry trees, other leaves have been tried as food for the worms, and bramble-tops have been found the best substitute.

Our attention was then drawn to another but not less pleasing object, our dinner, which on this, as on most other days of country travelling, consisted of macaroni, which we always got good, and fowls, the latter too often having but just ceased to exist. Our dessert, in the present instance, was easily furnished, as there was a vineyard close to us. was easily furnished, as there was a vineyard close to us. and the trees near us were covered with purple figs.

The air was charged, to an un- pleasant degree, with the perfume of wild thyme and other aromatic herbs, and swarmed with insects. Those on the ground were hardly less numerous. The heat after dark was suffocating, the thermometer at midnight standing at ninety degrees. The mules had been tied to the trees, and the mule- teers, rolled in their black cloaks, slept near them.                                ",

Before proceeding to describe its mag nificent remains, it may not perhaps be superfluous to give a slight sketch of the form and disposition of this species of building, to which so much importance was attached by the ancients. That part of the theatre appropriated to the audience, and called the coilon or cavea, formed either a semi-ellipse or a semicircle, generally the former, of which the proscenion or stage was the chord. Immediately in front of the latter was the orchestra, forming an oblong parallelogram raised a little out of the conistra or pit, and intended for the accommodation of the musicians and chorus. Among the Romans it had a different destination, being reserved for the emperor, senators, vestal virgins, and other persons of high rank. The conistra, which bore no proportion to the pit of our theatres, was semi- circular, and surrounded by rows of stone benches, generally twenty-four in number, gradually receding and rising above one another like steps. These were divided horizontally into three sets of eight benches in each,* by corridors or landing places, about four feet wide, called diazomata, which followed the sweep of the benches, and served as a means of commu- the sweep of the benches, and served as a means of commu- nication between one part of the coilon and another, at the * They were not thus equally divided in all cases: in the theatre at Mor viedro, the ancient Saguntum, there are seven benches in the lower division. six in the middle, and ten in the upper; and in the theatre which has occa- sioned these remarks, there are supposed to have been twelve benches in each of the lower divisions, and nine in the remaining one.

The streets are unusually wide, of great length, and intersect each other at right angles; and though the prevailing style of architec- ture exhibits too much of the confused ornaments, broken lines, and vitiated taste of the last and preceding century, the general effect is far from unpleasing. The town was so nearly annihilated by the tremendous eruption of \u00c6tna in 1669, and by the subsequent earthquake of 1693, that the Duke of Ca- mastro caused the little which remained to be pulled down, so that there might be no obstruction to rebuilding it on a more improved plan.

Conside- rable discussion has prevailed as to the derivation of its clas\u00ac sical and more general appellation, some deducing it from the Hebrew XX, a furnace, and others from the Greek Aloivn, because it burns; but the question after all is of little im- portance. The circumference of the mountain at its base has given rise to a still greater diversity of opinion, Brydone and Recupero having calculated it at 183 miles, while Houel makes it only forty. By tracing it, however, along its natural boun- it only forty. By tracing it, however, along its natural boun- daries, the sea, the Giarretta, and the Alcantara, it is very evident that it cannot be much more or less than ninety miles in circuit. The three regions or zones into which it is divided by nature, have been justly remarked as affording an epitome of                          ",

The Athenians were led into the quarrel originally (B. C. 412) by the artifices of the inhabitants of Egesta. Much difference of opinion prevailed amongst the popular leaders at Athens, with respect to the prudence of the step they were about to adopt. Nicias, who with Lamachus was eventually appointed to the command, was from the first averse to the expedition; and after it had been decided upon, the opinion of Lamachus, who wished at once to attack Syracuse, was not followed out. When the Athenian force at last arrived in the harbour, they encamped in the Olympieum, the temple being held by the Syracusans, and in all the proceedings during the first year the invaders were successful. Alcibiades, who had at Athens urged the undertaking of the siege, had in the mean time been tried for his life, and escaped to Sparta, where he backed up the solicitations of the Syra- cusan ambassadors for assistance, and Gylippus was appointed general by the Laced\u00e6monians, and ordered to go into Sicily. The Athenians, after a battle in which Lamachus was killed, occupied the high ground of Epipol\u00e6, and pressed the siege with such vigour, that surrender was talked of by the inhabi- tants of the city. The arrival of a messenger from Gylippus, followed speedily by that of the general himself, gave a new aspect to affairs. He sent at once to Nicias, giving him five days during which he might withdraw; but the Athenian leader, confident of success, prepared for battle, in which he was worsted.

He, we are told, kept a house open to all comers, and on one occasion entertained 500 knights, whom he not only boarded and lodged, but also provided with dresses. His cellars were calculated to holc 300 large vessels, each containing 100 amphor\u00e6. The same magnificence was extended to their sepulchres, stately monu- ments being by them erected even for horses; while some idea of the extent to which they carried their ordinary attentior to personal comfort may be formed from the restrictions placed on those engaged in the watch during the time of siege, who were only allowed the luxuries of a stuffed mattress, blanket, bolster, and pillow.I But this city boasted more distinguished men than those mentioned. Here was born Empedocles, the historian, ora tor, and poet, to whom perhaps the first place may be as- signed. The manner of his death is familiar to every classical student. \u201c Deus immortalis haberi Dum cupit, Empedocles ardentem frigidus \u00c6Etnam Insiluit. HoR. ARS POET. * Diod. Sic. xiii.

About noon the Abate arrived, and finding us quite ready lost no time, but put on a nightcap under his hat, and led the way as before. Our first halt was at the pillar of Hercules. He discoursed at great length upon this subject, about which he clearly felt great difficulties, and talked so seriously of the matter that our gravity was nearly upset. Cicero, it appears, says that the Temple of Hercules was near the Forum; Lopresti had a site which answered very well for that place, but unluckily a site which answered very well for that place, but unluckily Livy places the Forum in a position that would not at all agree with the site of the temple.

M., going over the same ground as we had traversed on the 17th, the weather even more disagreeable, cold, and damp than on that day. We kept our line as well as we could across the waste land, but got once completely astray ; luckily we made ourselves heard by a pecoraro, whose goats were browzing about, and who responded to the call, and came to us. He was dressed ex- actly like the pictures of Robinson Crusoe, in goat-skins, an axe slung over his shoulder, and a long pole in his hand. He put us into the proper track, and we soon afterwards found ourselves at the Fondaco della Nucilla, the host and hostess as civil as ever, and the children still all but in the fire. We resisted their entreaties to remain, except for the time needed by the mules, and, after a most wretched day, arrived again at Patti. We found our Syracusan muleteer, Bastiano, in great force, quite excited by seeing us again, fancying that we had gone, as he said, to heaven.

Having come under the dominion of the Romans, it suffered much from the rapacity of Verres, who carried away considerable plunder from it, including a famous statue of Mercury.

We met a young priest who was wandering about the place, and he kindly accom panied us to the site of the theatre, and pointed out the beauty ofits situation, while he gave us information about the different localities in sight from it. Taking leave of our conductor, we regained, by a steep descent, our road at Oliveri. Near that village is another called Tonnaro, deriving its name either from a corruption of the name of the mountain or from that from a corruption of the name of the mountain or from that of the fish, but probably the latter. The inhabitants follow the profession of fishermen with great success, and we saw many of their large boats hauled up on the beach. Tunny is held in the same estimation as it was of old, and the prepa- rations for its capture are made on an extensive scale. It is a gregarious fish, and, in general, makes its appearance in the a gregarious fish, and, in general, makes its appearance in the Mediterranean in the early part of the year; May, June, and July being the months during which it is captured. The nets are of great size, being as much as 1500 feet in length, by 300 in breadth, and from forty to 100 feet in depth. They are divided into four compartments, which communicate. These are secured by anchors or heavy weights, in the line where the fish are known to take, while the upper part is floated by the fish are known to take, while the upper part is floated by casks.

When the mules had concluded their feed, we got on to Milazzo, the ancient Myl\u00e6, where the Locanda del Sole re- ceived us, after a pleasant ride, as the weather had cleared up and the evening felt more like spring than winter. November 22.\u2014The bright days of Milazzo were those during which it was occupied by the British troops, and many were the regrets expressed by the persons on the spot, whe spoke of the subject, that the flag of England did not stil waye over them. Politics aside, it does seem a great pity that we could not retain the whole concern, as, under good management, it ought to be a valuable addition to any crown. The town stands on a narrow peninsula, extending for some distance seaward. At the furthest point is the castle, which commands the whole of it, and appears to be a very strong place. There are several churches and convents in the town, and its inhabitants are stated to amount to about 5000. In the course of our rambles we fell in with a boy who had formed one of our party when starting originally from Messina, and had been sent back on account of ill health. As he had a mule with him for hire, we dismissed the muleteer who a mule with him for hire, we dismissed the muleteer who had come from S. Stefano, and re engaged our friend.

That matter was easily settled, and we soon afterwards found ourselves, after an absence of eleven weeks, ensconced in our old quarters at the Leone d\u2019Oro. To complete our tour, we engaged a lettiga day or two after our arrival, and drove off to the Faro di Messina, on the extremity of Cape Pelorus, the north-east angle of Sicily.

Anxious not to lose time by waiting for it, we discussed and rejected a variety of plans for the journey to Naples. At one moment we hoped to be able to reach Taranto, and travel north through that district, which is but little seen by travellers. Dif- ficulties, however, arose, which made that plan impracticable.
