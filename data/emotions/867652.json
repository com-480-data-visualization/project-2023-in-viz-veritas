DONINO INVICIO NOSIRO AVCVSTO MAXENTIO VII PIO FELICI Thave copied these inscriptions just as they are; but the blunders in the letters and false spelling must be attributed, partly to the ignorance or care\u00ac lessness of thework-man, and partly to time, which may have carried off part of some of the letters. These errors and defects one often meets with in antique inscriptions, which make it sometimes very difficult to understand them. You see in this last inscription, that there is in DOMINO an N instead of an M, in NOSTRO an 1 instead of a N instead of an M, in NOSTRO an 1 instead of a T, and in the like manner in INVICTO, and a C instead of a G in AVCVSTO.

I shall not presume to waste your time, by tediously describing what the Ostracism was; it being very well known not onely to you, but to every one that has made any progress in the Grecian history: I shall only produce a passage of DIODORUS SICULUS, who describes the O\u00ac stracism, from which was derived the Petalism of the Syracusians.* But since it often happens, of the Syracusians.* But since it often happens, that men affect tyrannic government, the people (of the Syracusians) was induced to imitate the A\u00ac thenians, and to enact a law like theirs concern\u00ac ing the Ostracism. For among the Athenians, every citizen was obliged to write down upon a piece of a tile the name of any person, who seemed to be in such a way, as to be able some time or to be in such a way, as to be able some time or other to exercise tyranny over his fellow-citizens: but among the Syracusians, to write the name of each over-grown citizen upon an olive-leaf; and the leaves being counted, he, whose name appeared upon * \u03a4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f41 \u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03b8\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b9\u00ac \u03bc\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u1ff3 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u00ec \u1f40\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6. \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f00\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f15\u03ba\u03b1\u00ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03bd \u1f14\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f45\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd\u0387 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u00ac \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u1ff3 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u00ac \u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd\u0387 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1\u00ac  \u03b2\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c6\u03b5\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd.

However, this person was of opinion, that the true Tar\u00ac peian rock lay on the other side towards Monte Caprino: which, he said, was not onely the opinion of the ancients, but was confirmed by tradition, and by the present inhabitants. He directed me to a garden on Monte Caprino, where there is a place in which they play at bowls, a game called il jocalitio: at the end of which garden there is a very craggy and steep precipice, almost perpendicular; which hangs over the piazza of the church della Consolatione, and to me seems much higher than that on the north-west. LIVY gives an account of the steep\u00ac ness and craggyness of this south- east precipice, ness and craggyness of this south- east precipice, and among other circumstances relates that * 6 a piece of the rock tumbled down, and killed : several people in the Vicus Jugarius,33 which lay * Saxum ingens, sive imbribus, sive motu terrae leviore, qu\u00e0m ut alioqui sentiretur, labefactatum, in vicum Jugarium ex Capitolio procidit, et multos oppressit.

Accordingly five hoops of iron were fixed round it, on the outside, to brace and hold it fast together. There were no fewer than fifty cracks running and dispersing themselves here and there, being visible to the eye within here and there, being visible to the eye within the church; and some of them were so wide the church; and some of them were so wide that they passed quite through, and in one I could lay three of my fingers. To repair these, \u00e0 scaffolding was necessary; but to make one from the pavement of the church to the top, would have been not onely vastly expensive, but like wise very inconvenient; especially as the great altar stands just under the center of the cupola. To avoid both these objections, ZA\u00ac BAGLIA made a scaffolding, which had its base or foundation upon the cornice of the church, or foundation upon the cornice of the church, which goes round where the cupola begins. On this cornice he laid out tyo beams, and upon these beams run up the whole scaffold, concave wise, quite to the lantern; so that the upper part hung perpendicular: and, what is very extraordinary, he made no holes in the walls to receive the ends of the timber; but the whole was so well connected, that it was supported was so well connected, that it was supported entirely ",
