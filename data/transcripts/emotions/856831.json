The nature of the lava-rock prior to its volcani- sation is not known: it would seem, however, to be homogeneous, liquefying in all parts of the world at much the same temperature, and everywhere re- at much the same temperature, and everywhere re- taining its heat for a length of time which is diffi- cult to account for. The scori\u00e6e, ashes, and vitrified matter shot forth in gaseous explosions have a to\u00ac tally distinct character and are never liquefied. Probably the lava has a base of clay with lime and alum combined. Iron from time to time mingles with this, and hence on the crater\u2019s edge you will always find it in some form or another.

The eruptions are unquestionably due to a super- abundance of moisture: when the water is decom- posed explosive gases result. Hence, earthquake\u00ac shocks generally coincide with the throes of the mountain. A very wet season is always followed by one dangerous to those who dwell near a volcano: it has been noted also that in the first stages of an eruption streams of salt water are sometimes vomited. Volcanoes, moreover, throughout the known world, stand in the vicinity of seas, as Coto- paxi, Hecla, Etna, Vesuvius, &amp;c. Stromboli is in paxi, Hecla, Etna, Vesuvius, & Stromboli is in the sea. Some one has observed that where a sea has retired, or the inland lake dried up, the volcano has become extinct. Now all this dangerous activity of the water would alone lead one to think of clay as the base; for that substance is imper\u00ac vious to water, and when the chambers within the mountain\u2019s jaws are heated they act as boilers and generate steam. There is another and distinct reason for assuming a base of clay, and that is the apparent fact that old lavas return to the state of clay, as is seen in the Solfaterra.

He charged his hearers with corruptness of motive, deadness of heart, and lack of divine charity: avowing that there is no true freedom but perfect freedom, and that if we had the mind of Christ we should take his yoke upon us and seek the sal- vation of our brethren more earnestly than we at present seek our own. The amount of extempore eloquence was very great : and it never swelled into bombast or strayed into vagueness.

The tongue being then liberated, the bleeding must be allowed to continue until it ceases of itself. Then is to be given the first dose of the remedy : \u201c Three quarters of an ounce (1\u00bd loth) of the gentiana cruciata are to be given as a maximum dose; the root being first pounded, and then macerated in water, so as to form a thin paste ; this must be repeated every morning for nine days.

There is good reason to believe that the river Arno an- ciently ran into the Tiber by a branch called the Clanis, traversing what is now the Val di Chiana: when this commu- nication with the Tiber was lost, the district deprived of it came into a miserable condition. It would seem that from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century the above order has been reversed: the Clanis has changed the direction of its course, and has furnished a tributary to the Arno. In the lapse of ages this change has produced serious results. In the year 1789, Count Fossombroni laid before the Grand Duke a digested plan for operating on an entire province by the\u201c colmata \" system. He chose the Clanis for his instrument, a stream which had for a long while been for his instrument, a stream which had for a long while been doing much injury to the Arno, by introducing into that river heavy pebbles, and a mass of alluvial matter, thus choking its channel, and raising the level of its bed ; these evils had existed for nearly four centuries, and it appears that during that interval as many as thirty-one destructive floods had prevailed at diffe\u00ac as many as thirty-one destructive floods had prevailed at diffe\u00ac rent times. Fossombroni\u2019s \u201c colmata\" at once realised two great benefits; it filled up the marsh with alluvial soil as the waters of the torrent subsided, and it afterwards carried on a filtered stream into the Arno. This, however, being an effect artificially produced, it was soon found that it needed to be regulated with the utmost caution. The influx into the Arno amounted to perhaps five times the volume of water which ran in before; yet no floods ensued. So great an additional velocity had been communicated to the river, that its surface was not swollen by the additional body of water. This was in accord- ance with principles which Torricelli had before established by actual experiment ; that great man found that you may even                                     ",

Torricelli had also proved that, in order to drain the incumbent streams and pools from off a champaign country, it is not sufficient to give a slope to the channel of the canal, but that the \u201c Campagna\u201c itself must be made to assume the form of an inclined plane: thus, the r\u00e9gion in question now slopes sensibly from south to north. Fossombroni, therefore, was obliged to regulate the speed of the tributary according to an exact gradation ; and this, while car- rying on his\u201c colmata\" operations on a grand scale. Constant supervision was needed. He found that if the speed commu- nicated to the Arno were allowed to pass a certain point, large pebbles and boulders would be lifted from the bed of the river and carried too far down the stream. This has actually occurred in that part of the channel which faces Florence, and the bottom is there too much raised. The engineer was fain to put bar- is there too much raised. The engineer was fain to put bar- riers and dykes a little higher up than the point of influx of the torrents, in order to limit the speed of the Arno. After arranging the whole system, Fossombroni said, and rightly,\u201c you must now keep up this which I have set going: do not abandon the \u2019 colmata,\u2019 do not remove the dykes, or do not abandon the \u2019 colmata,\u2019 do not remove the dykes, or mischief will follow : remember, this condition of things is not natural, but artificial.\u201c The event, as I have observed in the text, has proved how well he judged. It is evident that the \u201c colmata,\" if it had been applied ages ago, would have preserved some noble bays which are now lost to Italy ; for what has been called \u201c the retiring of the sea,\" is, in fact, a formation of stony banks and shallows, due to con- tinual deposits from the different torrents flowing towards the sea.

As to the vast number of churches in Rome, I certainly hold it to be an unhealthy symptom. True, Italy was from the first full of bishops, because full of cities; for wherever the emperor full of bishops, because full of cities; for wherever the emperor recognised a city, there the servants of Christ established Gods altar, that prayers might be offered up.

Father Tiber, the Campagna might be conveniently laid under water, say twenty square miles at a time, and the same result obtained as in the valley of the Chiana. If any feel inclined to smile at this, let them remember that far more difficult and expensive measures have been proposed before now. It has even been gravely debated whether it would not be well to pave the entire Campagna! It need hardly be observed that Fos- sombroni\u2019s method, if adopted, would repay all expenses a hundredfold, by converting an unfruitful waste into rich alluvial soil (see Note 6), besides fully obviating the present daily increasing evil of a pestilential \u201c malaria. NoTE (h). The states of Italy desire freedom ; but are they fit for it ? Have they, indeed, profited by the history of past events? Are their people in this sense arrived at years of discretion? Could they safely choose for themselves, or any one of them devise a form of government comparable to that under which they are living? Take, for instance, Tuscany, now a grand-dukedom. Here consolidation is strength, and dismemberment would en- tail weakness and dissolution. Yet Siena would fain be inde- pendent ; even Florence sighs after the days of the republic. Perhaps something might be done (hitherto unattempted) to better the condition of such towns as Pisa and Siena; but assuredly not by separation. The prosperity of Leghorn is due to its being a sea-port, and to the English residents within its to its being a sea-port, and to the English residents within its walls. In Lombardy there is no lack of fair and thriving cities: Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Padua\u2014 to say nothing of its capital, Milan: there is, indeed, a certain sluggishness in them all, and the energies of the people might be far more widely developed the energies of the people might be far more widely developed than they are; but this a mercantile, rather than a political than they are; but this a mercantile, rather than a political question; and probably more would be gained for any one of them by discovering a new process of winding silk or of                                  ",

The chief resources of Venice at this day are its manufactories of glass and its fabric of delicate gold chains. If any part of Italy is to gain by a change in outward government, it must be the Papal States; and yet, assuredly whenever the experiment of bettering things is tried here, it will be attended with extreme peril. It is true that the people in these states are governed according to ideas incompatible in these states are governed according to ideas incompatible with human progress or the business of daily life, and that their polity is maintained in existence by other surrounding powers: but this has long been so ; and Rome has probably varied less, taking it all in all, than any other capital in Europe during some centuries past.
