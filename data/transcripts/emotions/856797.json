He has represented on the roof theology, philosophy, poesy, and jurisprudence, each by an expressive emblem; and has more fully characterized those subjects underneath by large pictures surmounting a freize, which, with its caryatides, was painted by Polidoro Caravag- gio, after Rafaello's designs. The first painting which Rafaello finished was that of theology generally known under the name of the Dispute upon the Sacrament. In this picture there is more of the dryness of Perugino than the elegance of Masaccio; and Rafaello, not having yet risen above his age, has made a confession of poverty in his art, by describing the rays of glory round in his art, by describing the rays of glory round Jesus Christ and the saints by bands of gold.

The Germans affirmed that their nation was the original one. The art in question immediately followed that of printing, which was undoubtedly of transalpine birth. Even in printing cards of amusement, Germany antedated Italy.

The art of multiplying copies of any impres\u00ac sion was soon applied to more important ends than those of mere amusement. Figures of saints with short legends were printed, and many other books on subjects of the popular religion succeeded.

The Neapolitan Academy can boast of well filled professorships of most branches of deep and polite learning. The number of scholars is great, and the tone of intellect is high.

The first literary appearance of the popular idiom was in poetry. Dante speaks of the vernacular dialect as having existed only one hundred and fifty years, and of its being used by poets to please their mistresses, who were but imperfectly acquainted with Latin.

Pisa was distracted by various aspirants for sovereignty, and at length Count Ugolino's ambition was successful; at the ex\u00ac pense, however, of some dishonorable and treacherous actions. But his foe, the archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, the head of the Gua\u00ac landi, Sismondi, Lanfranchi, and other Ghibel\u00ac line families, seized the moment of the defection of the fickle populace from Ugolino, and poured into their credulous ears an exaggerated tale that he had sold his country to Florence.

They remained in the usual state of the confined, till the Pisans locked the door of the prison, threw the key into the Arno, and kept from them their common allowance of food.

But Dante was not always intelligible to common readers. He had enriched the poetical language of his country, by introducing into it many forcible and beautiful words taken from the vari- ous vernacular idioms of Italy. He sometimes usedthem in their general acceptation; but often the difficulties of his subject compelled him to apply them in new significations, and those diffi\u00ac culties occasion the Divina Commedia to abound in poetical licences.

The father and mother died about 1326, and Francesco and a brother were left with a very small patrimony.

Although his own individual scholarship was imperfect, his example diffused a taste for Greek literature. In con\u00ac sequence, however, of the extreme rarity of Greek books, curiosity gradually died away. Nor did he confer inferior benefits on Italian than on Greek literature. Boccaccio always considered Dante as the first of modern poets; and it was his unceasing care to inspire the Florentines with a liberal admiration of their illustrious citizen.

Not that he was the inventor of it : for in a rude form it existed among the Sicilian poets; and is even to be met with in the poems of the Troubadours. He used the ottava rima in his early poems of the Theseida and the Filostrato. There is another circumstance in these poems interesting to the history of poetry.

Each person told one tale a day. Ten days formed the time of the continuance of the party, and, therefore, the compound word Deca- merone is given to the budget of stories. It is an amusing proof Boccaccio's fondness for Greek literature, that he has given a Greek title Greek literature, that he has given a Greek title to his book, and Greek names to the ladies and to his book, and Greek names to the ladies and gentlemen who recite the tales. To assemble several persons, whose object it is to narrate tales, is a common artifice in Oriental literature, and was well known in Europe in Boccaccio's time, by French and Latin translations of a collection                              ",

Chaucer has adopted the fashion which the popu\u00ac larity of Boccaccio gave rise to, of investing tales in a dramatic form: but he has infinitely improved on his original, by collecting a number of pilgrims, who agreed to deceive the road, by telling tales. Each person speaks agreeably to his character and circumstances; and the judi\u00ac cious appropriation of stories to individuals is a great subject for the exercise of the author's ingenuity. The want of this harmony makes Boccaccio\u2019s machinery occasionally appear cum\u00ac brous. Besides, as pilgrimages were often made excursions of pleasure as well as of religion, the telling of tales was a natural part of the enter\u00ac tainment, much more conformable to situation than amusement of that sort in the midst of a public calamity. Few of the tales in the Decamerone are the perfect creations of Boccaccio's genius. Most of them existed already in a rude shape.

For the completion of the formidable cupola, he named as architects, Dominico Fontana, and, Jacopo della Porta, the latter of whom had been a pupil of Jacopo Barrozzio, who for some years had conducted the works. With the permission of the Pontiff, the new architects altered Michelangiolo's plan by making it more elliptical, thinking that form of the cupola would be more graceful. Some change in the lanthorn intended to surmount the cupola was necessarily projected. The execution of the new plan was com\u00ac menced on the 15th July, 1588. Six hundred workmen, animated by the exhortations and blessings of the Pope, laboured day and night, and the undertaking was so quickly completed, that the last stone, blessed by the Pontiff after a solemn mass, was laid on the 14th May, 1590., amidst a discharge of artillery from the castle of St. Angelo. Ten years instead of only twenty- two months ought to have been employed in this work. The evils of this precipitation have been found in some subsequent examinations of the cupola. Urban VII. was the reigning pontiff at the time of the completion; Sixtus had died some months before. The lanthorn was raised by Vignola. The portico was not yet executed; nor had Michelangiolo thought of the sacristy, and many other usual parts of Christian temples. An alter- ation of the established plans was, therefore, n\u00e9cessary, and unluckily for St. Peter's and the arts, Pope Paul and unluckily for St. Peter's and the arts, Pope Paul IV. approved of the alterations, which one Carlo Ma\u00ac derno proposed: a more miserable artist never lived in short-lived popularity.

Innocent X. appointed commissioners to examine the state of the portico and the belfry, and they discovered that the portico had been raised upon earth and rubbish which were continually loosened by water.

They were designed by Sandro Botti\u00ac celli, the painter, and engraved by him or Baccio Baldini, the goldsmith. Baldini was a skilful engraver, but as he was ignorant of design, he was obliged to work after he was ignorant of design, he was obliged to work after the designs of Botticelli. This book has been thought to be the first in which the art of engraving in taille douce on metal, whether copper or a softer material was used.

He divided the drama into two parts; one part was sung before, and the other after the sermon; the interest of the auditors the other after the sermon; the interest of the auditors was excited by the commencement, and Neri's object was effected, of inducing people to remain during the sermon.

The first sacred drama or oratorio in which recitative was used, was called or oratorio in which recitative was used, was called L'anima e corpo, and was performed in the oratory of the church of Santa Maria della Vallicella at Rome, in the year 1600.
