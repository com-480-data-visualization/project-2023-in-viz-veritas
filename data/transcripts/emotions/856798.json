(2) Machiavelli wrote his chief work, the\u201c Prince, during his retirement at San Casciano. In a letter to his friend, Francesco Vettori, dated in the month of December, 1513, he says, that a work on the mode by which states may be ac- quired, preserved, and lost, would be acceptable to a prince, particularly to one whose power was to a prince, particularly to one whose power was but recent. He had thoughts of presenting it to Giuliano, a younger brother of Pope Leo X., and governor of Florence. He declares it to be absolutely necessary that he should dedicate it to some distinguished character, otherwise he should fall into such a state of poverty as would render him an object of contempt.(3) This melan- choly reason, as stated by Machiavelli himself, is an ample refutation of all the fine woven hypo- theses respecting the origin of the Prince, which                              ",

The work was, however, in the end, dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici, the political enemy of Machiavelli, and who, on account of the vigorous and tyrannical frame of his mind, was appointed by his uncle, Pope Leo X., to supplant Giuliano in the government of Florence. The fundamental principle of Machiavelli is, that every sovereign must be a villain, because all the world is villainous. No man ever looked more gloomily at human nature than Machiavelli. His own experience of the depraved and fero- cious manners of his age made him conclude that all men were wicked, that their innate vice only wants occasions for its display, and that they never do good unless by external compulsion. He thinks only of the interest of sovereigns, and that interest is not regarded by him as connected with morals, and the general welfare, but with the acquisition and stability of absolute power.

They can revenge themselves of slight offences: but if we injure them, it should be done so effectually as to prevent the possibility of retaliation. As models of princes who have of retaliation. As models of princes who have attained and preserved their power by crimes, he instances the most flagitious wretches in ancient and modern times. Machiavelli's imagination could not picture a patriot king. In C\u00e6sar Borgia, he says he can find nothing to reprehend. He deliberately proposes that pest of mankind as an example, to those who by fortune or arms have been elected to sovereign rule. Indeed, when Machiavelli was Florentine secretary of embassy, he applauded Borgia (the ally of the state) for murdering some chiefs of Condottieri (execrable wretches, certainly), whom Borgia had invited to his territories under pretence of con- cord.

This remark may, however, be softened by a maxim which he has given in another part of his work, that a prince ought to perform acts of mercy personally himself, and that all acts of rigour should be done by his ministers. Machiavellism, it has been often said, existed long before the time of Machiavelli. It has always been a great principle of the Italian states in their domestic politics, but our author reduces into rules the practice of his predeces- sors. The system is completely unfolded in the eighteenth chapter of the Prince. He says, the eighteenth chapter of the Prince. He says, that there are two forms of contention, one with laws, the other with force. The first is the natural mode of combating the passions of men, the second is the way of subduing the ferocity the second is the way of subduing the ferocity of beasts, but as the first plan is not always suf- ficient, recourse must be had to the second. It is necessary, therefore, he concludes, that a prince should know the manner of conducting himself as a beast as well as a man.

Every one knows that it is honorable in a prince to keep his word, to act with plain honesty, and to keep his word, to act with plain honesty, and never to resort to craft ; but Machiavelli con\u00ac tends that such virtue is folly, because no prince of his time who had risen to greatness had at all respected moral obligations.

In them Machiavelli displayed himself the philosophical commentator on history, the able analyser of causes, the man who could draw political maxims from the most complicated or the most simple actions. Sometimes, however, he does not rise above the ignorance and vulgar super- stition of his age. It is a lamentable proof the inequality of genius to find Machiavelli contending that all important changes in the political world are predicted by divination, or prodigy, or astrology.

Antonio Francesco Grazzini, sur\u00ac named Il Lasca, a Florentine of honourable family but decayed fortunes, is a writer of burlesque poetry. The combat of the Giants with the Gods, la guerra de' Mostri, is the poem that relaxes the severity, and dissipates the gloom of the Italian countenance. Grazzini's talents are of an high order. In his novels he approaches the elegance and purity of Boccaccio's style, and his few tragic tales show that he possessed the power of commanding the passions, as well as of interest- of commanding the passions, as well as of interest- ing the fancies of his readers. He has edited also the elegant songs which Lorenzo de' Medici and the poets, his contemporaries, composed for the carnival festivals at Florence, in place of the gross ballads that used to be sung on those occasions. The genius of Grazzini is gay and lively.

The study of classical letters and poetry was the intro\u00ac duction to the honours of the court, and to diplomatic offices. However, there is nothing peculiar in all this. Intellectual merit is re\u00ac warded in many other Italian cities. But I entered Ferrara, happy in the feeling that I was breathing the same air with a poet whom Dante and Petrar\u00e7a would have saluted as a brother; reflecting at the same time on the singular pro\u00ac phecy of Dante, that no poet would ever arise in Ferrara. For the purpose of knowing Ariosto, I intro\u00ac duced myself to Antimaco, the celebrated pro\u00ac fessor of the Greek language at Ferrara. He had acquired his erudition in Greece itself: he was one of the most perfect masters of ancient liter\u00ac ature in Italy; and had warmly applauded Leo's idea of a Greek college at Rome. (84) He received me with friendship, and offered to gra\u00ac tify my wish of seeing Ariosto.

When a nobleman engaged in manual occupations, his nobility was said to sleep, but the art of printing conferred honor on its pro\u00ac fessors. Hence it was very early practised by many men who were of noble families, and even by eminent ecclesiastics. The emperors of Ger\u00ac many permitted printers to wear gold and silver; and both Typographi and Typothet\u0153 were and both Typographi and Typothet\u0153 were honored by them with the privilege of wearing coat armour, to perpetuate the discovery of print\u00ac ing.

He used to call that city a ter\u00ac restrial Paradise, a place wherein he could in dulge the libertinism of his appetites, his tongue, and his pen. (76) It is difficult to determine whether avarice, licentiousness, or gluttony, were his ruling passion. How low must have been the tone of moral feeling, when the satire was dreaded, or the praise courted, of a man of such notorious im\u00ac morality! And yet he was admired or feared by the greatest political characters of his time. A person truly said to him, that he had van\u00ac quished more princes by his pen, than the greatest kings had conquered by their arms. He was styl\u00e9d by Ariosto, and others, the scourge of princes, and he caused two medals in bronze to be struck, in one of which he calls him\u00ac self th\u00e8\u201c flagellum principum, and in the other he boasts he had put under contribution those to he boasts he had put under contribution those to whom other men paid tribute.

His house was valuable for its library and botanical garden, and was the resort of the learned. Bembo lived in his villa-bozza, near Padua, from the year 1520 to 1529. As I did not meet Bembo again, I shall take the occasion of detailing his subsequent history, and of giving a character of his works. From 1529 to the year of his death, his works.

To amuse the court with his extemporaneous poetry, and to play on a curious silver lyre of his own construction, to erect a statue to the memory of Sforza\u2019s father, and to preside over an academy of architecture and painting, such an academy of architecture and painting, such were the objects of da Vinci's change of abode.

Similarity of literary inclinations united Onofrio Panvinio and Carlo Sigonio in friend\u00ac ship, and their generous emulation never degenerated into envy. Panvinio was a Veronese. He wrote trea- tises on the games, sacrifices, funerals, and, indeed, on almost every subject of classical history and mythology.

If he had lived, he would have published a complete ecclesiastical history. There is no doubt a complete ecclesiastical history. There is no doubt that Baronius profited much by the collections which he made from records and left in the Vatican. Panvinio wrote also an abridgment of most of the classicalauthors, with learned and critical notes. These were the fruits of a life that lasted only from 1529 to 1568.

This a wonderful work, because the author's labours had been so little aided by former compilers. But his most astonishing book, is that which relates to the his- tory of Italy, from the arrival of the Lombards to the middle of the thirteenth century. Tiraboschi justly calls that period a horrible desert, which no person had dared to enter. Sigonio visited all the churches and noble houses of Italy, particularly Lombardy, the part most connected with his subject.

The former author thought that medals were coins; Erizzo maintained that they were two different things.

A son named Aldo the Younger, succeeded him; he continued to reprint various clas\u00ac sics; but such had been the literary avidity of his father and grandfather, that Velleius Paterculus was father and grandfather, that Velleius Paterculus was the only author left for him to print for the first time. the only author left for him to print for the first time. He wrote many elegant and learned tracts on various points of philology, and was perfect a Ciceronian as Paolo. He was professor of belles lettres in the public institution at Venice, for young persons destined to occupy offices of state. In 1584 he was made a secretary of the senate. But his ambition was not satisfied. As his father and grandfather had printed, and re-printed, all the chief classics, there was no great critical sagacity wanted in a printer. A thousand other presses therefore rivalled the Aldine. The hope of better fortune induced him to quit Venice, in 1585. He became professor of eloquence at Bologna. The last person who occupied that chair was the famous C. Sigonio. Aldo soon removed to Pisa as professor of belles lettres, a place which the Medici family gave him in consequence of his very elegant life of Cosmo de' Medici. He was afterwards called to Rome to succeed to the professorship, vacant by the death of the illustrious Muretus. His lectures were well attended; \u00e0 fact necessary to mention, as there is an idle story abroad, that he was often obliged to pass the hours for lecture in promenading before the door of the hall,                                   ",

He acquired colouring from study of the pictures of Tiziano; design, taste, and chiaroscuro, from those of Michelangiolo, Rafaello, and Polidoro. The last of these masters was his great object of imitation till he studied Tintoretto. Palma's early works are the results of a judicious union of the best parts of the Venetian and Roman schools. They are all executed with a certain facility, which is the great talent of this master, but a talent as dangerous in painting as in poetry. Paolo Veronese and Tintoretto occupied the in poetry. Paolo Veronese and Tintoretto occupied the highest posts of honour.

The egotism of preachers, and their mixture of sacred and profane matters in sermons, are faults which Dante censured.

Non disse Cristo al suo primo Convento: Andate, e predicate al mondo ciance, Ma diede lor verace fondamento. quel tanto son\u00f2 nelle sue guance; E Si ch\u2019 a pugnar, per accender la Fede, Dell' Evangelio fero scudi e lance. Ora si va con motti, e con iscede, A predicare, e pi\u00f9 che ben si rida, Gonfia il cappuccio, e pi\u00f9 non si richiede. Ma tale uccel nel becchetto s'annida; Che se \u20191 vulgo il vedesse, vederebbe La perdonanza, di che si confida, Per cui tanta stoltezza in terra erebbe, Che sanza pruova d'alcun testimonio, Ad ogni promession si converebbe.

Christ said not to his first conventicle, Go forth and preach impostures to the world, But gave them truth to build on; and the sound Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they, Beside the Gospel, other spear or shield, To aid them in their warfare for the faith. The preacher now provides himself with store Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl Distends, and he has won the meed he sought. Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood, They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said, Which now the dotards hold in such esteem, That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad The hands of holy promise, finds a throng Of credulous fools beneath.

Barry's account of the destruction of this monument of modern art is very interesting in itself, and highly characteristic of his own rough and generous enthusiasm for Da Vinci.\u201c The Cenacolo of Lionardo da Vinci has been formerly retouched, which I had a fair oppor\u00ac tunity of seeing this day, as there was a scaffold erected by order of the Count de Firmian, secretary of state, for Pietro Mazzi, a painter. This Mazzi has, by order of the fore-mentioned count, defaced already almost one half of this picture of Lionardo, under the notion of repainting it. The villain would not content himself with mending and repairing the parts but injured and defaced in the picture, and securing the rest by means of a varnish, or some other method, he will paint it all over first in what is called a dead colour, and afterwards he will paint this dead colour over again with another he will paint this dead colour over again with another layer of his stupid colours, so as to bury Lionardo's work entirely: in what he has done, all is changed; in another month Da Vinci will no longer be found in this picture. It is impossible to see any thing finer, more expressive, or more characteristic, than one side of this picture, where Lionardo yet remains; or more unmean- ing, clumsy, and worthless, than the other side, wh\u00e8re this man has covered the picture, nearly all the figures on the right hand of the Christ, with his vile daubing.
