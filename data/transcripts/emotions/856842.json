When I rejoined Lord Byron at La Mira, on the banks of the Brenta, in the summer of 1817, 1 found him employed upon the fourth canto of \u201c Childe Harold, and, later in the autumn, he showed me the first sketch of the poem. It was much shorter than it afterwards became, and it did not remark on several objects which appeared to me peculiarly worthy of notice. I made a list of those objects, and, in conversation with him, gave him reasons for the selection. The result was the poem as it now appears, and he then engaged me to write notes for the whole canto. I performed this task chiefly at Venice, where I had the advantage of consulting the Ducal library, and was seduced by the attractions of the inquiry, and, if I may say so much, by my love for it, into a commentary too bulky for an appendix to the Poem. The consequence was the division of the notes into two parts, one of which was appended to the canto in the form of notes, the other appeared in a separate in the form of notes, the other appeared in a separate volume of \u2019Historical Illustrations. I mentioned this in the Preface to that volume, and I repeat it now to another generation, to account for venturing to write about Italy at all.

IN the summer of 1816 I visited Switzerland for the first time, and remained there until early in the following October. I passed those happy days with Lord Byron. chiefly at the villa Diodati, on the Savoy side of the lake of Geneva, but, occasionally, in short journeys to some of the spots usually visited by strangers. One was to Chamouni, another to the Grindelwald. Of the latter to Chamouni, another to the Grindelwald. Of the latter Lord Byron recorded short notices in a journal which he sent to his sister, and which Mr. Moore published in his Life. It was on our visit to Chamouni that a circum- stance occurred which has been so entirely distorted. and represented directly contrary to the fact, that Ifeel bound to mention it.

There, indeed, she gave full play to a dis\u00ac position most engaging and unaffected.

He informed us that he had served under Louis XVI., but said nothing of his other commander-in-chief, Napoleon. An Eng- lishman who should be equally communicative with one whom he had never seen before, and was never likely to see again, would be thought mad. At La Ripaille the church was turned into a barn, the towers, all but two, were razed, and a garden had been planted on the embanked buttresses. Over the front gate were still seen the arms of the Prince of Savoy, sur- mounted by that papal crown which he resigned for this sensual seclusion. The French, by an easy conversion, had made the tiara look like a cap of liberty.

From that moment discord arose between Murat and Eugene and their respective partizans, which put an end to all chance of co-operation between the Neapolitans and Lombards, and was, most probably, the real cause of the unfortunate policy adopted by the Viceroy at Mantua. The battle of Hanau afforded the Italians the last op- portunity of displaying their military genius beyond the Alps; and when General Zucchi, who commanded their contingent of the French army, returned to Milan, he proclaimed publicly that he was authorized to announce that Napoleon resigned the iron crown, released his Italian subjects and soldiers from their oaths, and left the whole of their armed force to work out the inde- the whole of their armed force to work out the inde- pendence of their common country.

It was satisfactory to find all parties agreed in one point; namely, that Monti, Pindemonte, and Foscolo were the living writers es- teemed as decidedly superior to all their contempo- raries. I have already told what I believe is the judgment generally formed in Italy of the merits of these distinguished authors.\u201c They are all dead. The last, the youngest of them, died first.

On the 7th of January, 1817, Lord Byron and 1 rowed to the Lido with two singers, one of whom was a car- penter, and the other a gondolier. The former placed himself at the prow, the latter at the stern of the boat. A little after leaving the quay of the Piazzetta, they began to sing, and continued their song until we arrived at the island. They gave us, amongst other essays, the Death of Clorinda, and the Palace of Armida; and did not sing the Venetian, but the Tuscan verses. The carpenter, however, who was the cleverer of the two, and was frequently obliged to prompt his com- panion, told us that he could translate the original. He added, that he could sing almost three hundred stanzas. but had not spirits (morbin was the word he used) to learn any more, or to sing what he already knew: a man must have idle time on his hands to acquire, or to repeat, and, said the poor fellow, \u201c look at my clothes and at me\u20141 am starving. This speech was more affecting than his performance, which habit alone can make attractive. The recitative was shrill, screaming, and monotonous, and the gondolier behind assisted his and monotonous, and the gondolier behind assisted his voice by holding his hand to one side of his mouth. The carpenter used a quiet action, which he evidently endeavoured to restrain; but was too much interested in his subject altogether to repress.

Mr. Walker, in his historical memoir, was bold enough to follow the old story even in the face of Serassi, who appears to me to have completely settled the question. Poetical gallantry will account for all the phenomena. Dr. Black himself wisely rejects the passion of love as the adequate cause of Torquato\u2019s insanity : but we may not perhaps subscribe to his opinion, that the poet lost his senses on account of the objections made to his Jerusalem. The biographer presumes him positively mad, and argues on his case out of Pinel, and Haslam, and others. On this ground he supposes the harsh conduct of the duke was adopted as necessary for the cure of Tasso (see chap. xv. p. 91, vol. ii.; chap. xii. vol. i. p. 808; chap. xv. vol. ii. p. 87; and chap. vol. ii.; chap. xii. vol. i. p. 808; chap. xv. vol. ii. p. 87; and chap. xvi. vol. ii. p. 113); and, if his meaning has not been mistaken, he almost apologises for the prescription of Alfonso. he almost apologises for the prescription of Alfonso.

The muse was encou- raged and confined to her laureate duties; and so care- fully was her gratitude secured, and her recompense so exactly weighed, that, the day before the Prince of Mantua obtained the liberation of Tasso, he commanded the captive to compose a copy of verses, as an earnest, it should seem, of more elaborate efforts.* The same prince imitated the example of Alfonso in retaining the MSS. of our poet, as a pledge for his future attachment to the house of Gonzaga; and having assigned him a small sum for his immediate exigencies, would not allow him to purchase clothes unless he would consent to wear them out in the duties of the Mantuan court. A thousand traits in the life of Tasso serve to show that genius was considered the property, not of the individual, but his patron; and that the reward allotted for this appropriation was dealt out with jealous avarice.

A difficulty has suggested itself to Serassi respecting the date of the will, which he contends cannot be that of the copy which he followed, for Tasso had left Ferrara before 1573, the year marked in the printed document: the date preferred by the biographer is 1570. The fact the date preferred by the biographer is 1570. The fact is, that the manuscript is written on a doubled sheet of paper, of which the will itself occupies the two sides of the first half-sheet, and the epitaph on his father, and the first half-sheet, and the epitaph on his father, and                                ",

Italian rivalry, in default of those contests which employed the arts and arms of the middle ages, now vents itself in the invidious comparison of individual fasti, and in the innocent, ostentatious display not of deeds but names.

There he passed the latter part of his life in a course of laborious study which shortened his days, and there might his ashes have been secure, if not of honour, at least of repose; but \u201cthe hy\u00e6na bigots of Certaldo, as Lord Byron calls them, tore up the tombstone of Boccacio and ejected it from the holy precincts of the saints.

The poet was one evening at the house of the Princess Carignani, and leaning, in one of his silent moods, against a side- board decorated with a rich tea-service of china, by a sudden movement of his long loose tresses, threw down one of the cups. The lady of the mansion ventured to tell him that he had spoilt her set, and had better have broken them all; but the words were no sooner said, than Alfieri, without replying or changing countenance, swept off the whole service upon the floor. His hair was fated to bring another of his eccentricities into play; for, being alone at the theatre at Turin, and hanging carelessly with his head backwards over the corner of his box, a lady in the next seat on the other side of the partition, who had, on other occasions, made several attempts to attract his attention, broke into violent and repeated encomiums on his auburn locks, which were flowing down close to her hand.

The tutor slowly read aloud and translated the Greek author, and Alfieri, with his pencil and tablets in hand, walked about the room and put down his version.

In that case the discrepancy between the present and the ancient circuit will be much diminished, if not altogether annihilated. To this it may be added, that as the works of Narses, and, indeed, of the Emperors, were of brick, they might, when once decayed, very easily be gradually lost; and that, when the Popes commenced their repairs, the diagonal of an irregular projection might here and there have been taken, instead of the former line, by which means a partial reduction, sufficient to account for the above difference, may be allowed to have taken place. It should seem that during the troubles of the Ex- archate the walls had fallen down in many parts, and that the city was left naked on some points, particularly towards the gate of St. Lorenzo.

The embellishment of the rising city, vigorously pur- sued till the middle of the seventeenth century, was the first object of the pontiffs: the preservation of the architectural remains appears to have been a rare and secondary design. When that embellishment had ceased to be the passion of the popes, the dilapidation may be supposed to have been discontinued. The last recorded destruction was that before mentioned of the arch in the Corso, by Alexander VII.

The Romans of the present day are not the last to allow, that until the late usurpation, either the will, or the means, or the method, had been wanting effectually to oppose the ravages of violence and time. The taste and magnificence of the popes must be sought, and will be found in the museums of the Vatican and the Capitol. It was reserved for the conquerors who plundered those noble repositories to recompense Rome for her losses, by clearing away the offals and dirt, which had accumulated for ages round the buried temples at the foot of the Capitol, and under the windows of the Senate House, by cleansing the base, and propping the porches of the Coliseum, by removing the soil in front of the Temple of Peace, by re-opening the Baths of Titus, and finally by excavating the Forum of Trajan, a work of itself superior to all the meritorious exertions of Sixtus Quintus and Braschi.
