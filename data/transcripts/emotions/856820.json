In enter\u00ac ing Pavia, I had observed a ruined, although modern gate, situated close to a castle of great extent, with four vast brick towers, once guarding the ramparts. I had marked the solitude and melancholy aspect of the spot, and wishing to view it more nearly, proceeded now, in the decline of day, through the dusky and dismal in the decline of day, through the dusky and dismal streets of the city, in pursuit of this object. It was growing dark, the shops were shut, no light appeared in any quarter, nor was any footstep heard save that of the any quarter, nor was any footstep heard save that of the sentinel. I perceived that I had missed my way to the old castle, but I found myself opposite to a structure, which (at least when seen in this dim light) seemed * In the anatomical school of Pavia I remarked a singular circumstance, and one which very much excited my attention : I saw four or five skulls belonging to that unfortunate race of beings denominated Cretins, the idiots of the Savoyard moun\u00ac tains. On examination of these skulls, I found them to be wonderfully thick, and all of them depressed at the great occipital hole, as if the head, being too heavy, had pressed too hard upon the alba ; the skulls are, at the same time, extremely large, and the whole head and bone have this most unusual thickness. On careful inquiry, I found that these symptoms constantly prevailed, never failing to appear the same in every particular. In so much, therefore, as regards the Cretins being the same in every particular. In so much, therefore, as regards the Cretins being idiots, the cause is explained, although I have never, upon any occasion, heard of this circumstance being noticed.\u2014Note by the Author.

This city, receiving the name of Parma from the Ro\u00ac mans, either because its form resembled that of a shield, or, perhaps, because it had served as a protection to them, was, together with Placentia, among the cities left by Charlemagne to his son Pepin. The distance of these towns from the seat of government rendered of these towns from the seat of government rendered revolt easy, and they soon erected themselves into inde\u00ac pendent republics. After this period, they belonged sometimes to the Duke of Milan, sometimes to the Pope; then becoming the property of the Ferranese, this family long reigned over them with the title of Dukes of Parma. Parma was next possessed by the French, in their revolutionary conquests ; and, finally, at the Congress of Vienna, was assigned to the Arch- Duchess Maria Louisa, wife of Buonaparte.

It appears that the original plan designed by Arnolfo for this building was finer than that finally adopted. It united symmetry with grandeur, and would have enabled him to plant the building, which now stands obliquely, in fair and just proportion. But he met with insurmountable obstacles. Among the buildings to be thrown down to clear a suf- ficient space for this great fabric, the habitations of the Ubati, attached to the Ghibellini faction, were designa\u00ac ted, and it was in vain that the architect reasoned or entreated ; he could not prevail with the people to suffer that any part or portion of the National Palace should touch the ground which these habitations had occupied; and while thus obstinate in their antipathies, their pre\u00ac dilection in favour of the antique tower of the Tira\u00ac bosche della Vacha led them to insist on it being incor\u00ac porated in the building.

The space originally allotted by the architect of the Palazzo Vecchio for this purpose, was guarded by a noble railing, but offered no shelter from the weather; to ob\u00ac viate which inconvenience, in the year 1355, the Loggia dei Lanzi was built in one angle of the square. The erection of this edifice naturally excited great interest ; and the object accordingly was pursued with that zeal and emulation, which then so peculiarly characterized this people.

IN proceeding to offer a few observations on the churches of this city, I am induced to select San Lorenzo for my first subject, not so much as the most conspicuous in architecture, as from the peculiar interest it derives from its connexion with the tomb of the Medici, which forms one of its chapels. Inthe earlier periods of the republic, San Lorenzo was considered the Metropolitan Church of Florence. Its existence is traced as far back as the year 393, when it was consecrated by St Ambrose ; at the distance of nearly three hundred years, on its receiving some repairs and embellishments, this ceremony was again performed by Pope Nicholas the Second in person. 2 F                     ",

A few vears afterwards it was again rebuilt from a design of Brunelleschi. The whole structure is considered as fine, an opinion sanctioned by Michael Angelo himself; but, according to my idea, its general aspect possesses none of that beauty arising from just proportions, so essential to sim\u00ac plicity and grandeur in architecture. It measures nearly 400 feet in length, and only 100 in width, (not including the chapels,) the body of the church is therefore ungrace the chapels,) the body of the church is therefore ungrace fully long, while the cross is proportionably too short. These defects are rendered more conspicuous by the unusual height of the pillars that divide the parts of the church, and which greatly contribute to make the inter- mediatespaces appear still more narrow. The church itself may be said to possess few claims to admiration ; but its chapels are highly interesting. One of these was planned by Cosmo, first Grand Duke of Florence, after a design of Vasari's, being intended as a Mausoleum for the Medicean family. At a later period, the original intention having been partly changed, and the whole enlarged, it was finished under the auspices of his successor, Ferdinand the First.

The answer is to be found in the manners of the Greeks, which peculiarly encouraged the progress the Greeks, which peculiarly encouraged the progress of talent in these pursuits, and offered the finest oppor\u00ac of talent in these pursuits, and offered the finest oppor\u00ac tunities for study.

He saw, in these displays of agility and strength, the noblest forms in all the animation of contest ; and roused to the greatest exertion by that hope of distinction, which the rewards bestowed on the successful competi\u00ac tor were so well calculated to produce. But besides this, the artists themselves were honoured and distinguished in a manner unknown in modern times. The riches lavished in rewarding their labours is a matter of history, and personal honours of the high\u00ac is a matter of history, and personal honours of the high\u00ac est degree were bestowed upon them. The effect that est degree were bestowed upon them. The effect that this must have had in exciting animation and talent is evident. The nature of their mythology was equally import\u00ac ant. In our religion the subjects are grand, noble, and impressive ; but almost too sacred for the pencil or chisel. The mythology of the Greeks was, on the con\u00ac trary, gay and animating. Even while seeking to repre- sent the splendour of the Deity, grand severe in dignity, the ancients have surpassed us. There is no comparison between the Almighty, by Raphael, and the Jupiter of Phidias, as described by ancient writers. The artist, whether in statuary or painting, owes his happiest efforts to imagination, to which imitation and recollec- tion alone contribute.                            ",

If anatomy had been much known to the ancients, their knowledge would not have remained a subject of speculation. We should have had evidence of it in their works; but, on the contrary, we find Hippocrates spending his time in idle prognostics, and dissecting apes, to discover the seat of the bile.

Their emblems of death were not like ours, the repre- sentations of the form into which the body is at length resolved; their signs were expressed by mourning genii, with an extinguishing torch.

One circumstance strongly indicating that the chief studies of the Greek artist had been in the Circus, is, that nearly all their male figures are nudes, especially when in action, such as their wrestlers, athlet\u00e6, gladia\u00ac tors, and discoboli.

To the first query I should reply by asking, what need had they of anatomy, who studied so well a surer rule? what could it offer to those, who like them had the means of viewing, in the living body, the most perfect forms of manly beauty? To the second I should answer, that anatomy, skilfully and sparingly applied, is the best substitute for the more animated exhibitions of the circus and theatre. the circus and theatre.

My first impressions of Florence have all been by moonlight, in solitary evening walks. The heats of the day are excessive, and as there is no twilight, it is in the serene and silent midnight hour that you love to wander forth, and inhale the cool breeze and freshened air- How beautiful it is to gaze on the splendour of the moonbeams, reflected on the Arno, showing its bridges in grand perspective, the city, and its huge masses of ancient buildings, lying in deep full shadow before you. the rays hardly reaching to the centre of the narrow the rays hardly reaching to the centre of the narrow streets, while they glitter on the tops of towers and buildings, whose projecting square roofs, almost touch\u00ac ing each other, rear their ponderous bulk against the clear blue sky.
