However, I will not ven\u00ac ture to assert, that the representation of harlequin on the Italian stage is in all cases so totally different from what I have seen it elsewhere ; for as this particular play was vigorously hissed, and as every thing in it was found fault with, it may be that Harlequin, as well as other characters, was misrepresented in it. I can only say that he had no greater share than the rest in the universal disapprobation. I cannot close this sketch of the Milan stage, without saying something of the pleasure which the spectators afforded me. I had no idea of the degree of interest which it was possible to take in a drama, however well performed.

This not the case: there are bridges every where ; and you may live in Venice twenty years, and go to every part of it (except an island or two which form a sort of suburbs,) without ever making use of a boat.

There were several painters of very great eminence, in what is called the Venetian School; but all of them, as it appears to me, had some peculiar ble\u00ac mishes, which in a great measure spoil the effect of their works and diminish their lustre. The first and most glaring of their defects was, that of always copying from individual nature, instead of working upon their own conceptions of ideal beauty. Their figures, whatever might be the sub\u00ac were invariably ject they were treating, portraits of Venetian gentlemen and ladies. They are in consequence remarkable for a certain sameness of feature and expression, which stamp them at once as individuals of the same nation. The women are almost universally represented with too short a face, and too prominent a nose,\u2014which are obvious peculiarities in the Venetians. In the living specimens, these defects are more the living specimens, these defects are more than compensated by the gracefulness of the attitudes and the animation of the counte\u00ac nances of the persons in whom they occur ; but these are charms for which motion and                            ",

The largest is that of San Chrysostome, which may contain 2,500 spectators : it has a very singular shape, being neither round nor oval: that part of the house which faces the stage is much broader than the rest, the stage is much broader than the rest, and contains eleven boxes in a straight line, together with two half-boxes at the corners, where the front and the side boxes join. This distribution produces a very awkward effect to the eye; but it is agree- able to have so many places in front. We found at this theatre a very bad set of actors, who performed operas. 2.

The theatre of San Luca is like the preceding, in size and in shape ; and was occupied by a company of comic actors, who performed tolerably well, though the prima Amorosa was neither young nor hand\u00ac some, and the Amoroso very unattractive. 5.

The inn was so full that we could only get one room and one bed, with a sofa, on which fatigue made me sleep soundly. The next morning, Friday, 29th Novem\u00ac ber, we hired an open carriage at the inn, in order to visit the celebrated cascade, formed by the Vellino, five miles from Terni. It certainly deserves its great repu\u00ac tation ; but we could only see it very imper\u00ac fectly and from above, owing to our being accompanied by a stupid Cicerone, whose assistance we had not desired.

He used to walk about the streets and publick places with a piece of charcoal in his hand, and wherever he met with a convenient clean place, he im\u00ac mediately drew figures which shewed un\u00ac common talent, and groups in which though there might sometimes be confu\u00ac sion, there was always taste and genius.

An intimate friend whose classical taste and ardent application to study, eminently qualified him to assist to study, eminently qualified him to assist me in such an investigation, had lately left Amsterdam, where his society had made the charm of my life, and his conversation the delight of all my leisure hours. It was impossible to know him without growing better\u2014by his example rather than by his advice: and though I did not profit by either as I ought to have done, he had so far succeeded in my reform, as to make me capable of perseverance in what I under\u00ac took, as well as more scrupulous in the choice of my pursuits.

Amongst the most remarkable antiquities of Rome, the Grotto where the nymph Egeria is supposed to have given such good advice to Numa Pompilius is still shewn, and is reverently visited by every traveller. Though at the risk of being thought insen- sible and unromantick, I must confess that 1 went to this grotto chiefly because others went; and like others I gathered some of the plants which grow in this holy-cave, as precious relicks to be preserved with pious care. With respect to Numa Pompilius, though I do not consider it as unquestion\u00ac ably certain that he was the second King of Rome,\u2014I am not on the other hand prepared to deny his very existence, and to consider all the seven kings as a mere alle\u00ac gory, having reference to the magical num\u00ac ber seven. This number, it has been ob\u00ac ber seven. This number, it has been ob\u00ac served, multiplied by itself, and the product multiplied by the other magical number of five, makes 245,\u2014the precise number of years which some writers allot to the 2C VOL.
