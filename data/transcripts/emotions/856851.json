In that sentiment, that real interest in per- fection of workmanship for the joy of doing a thing well, lies the reason of our success to-day, and of our hope for to-morrow.

The parts must not only be finely made, but exactly assembled, and the European workman loves his work enough to give that rare exactitude which makes the Swiss watches world-famous and the Italian automobile successful and pre-eminent in all tests.

Cavazza proposed seeing some of the interesting things in the town, and we started out first to see the exquisite Francia painting in the Benti\u00ac voglio chapel in the church of San Giacomo Maggiore. The monument of Antonio Bentivoglio is wonderfully fine, and is the work of Jacopo della Quercia, the man who was so sure of getting the prize, and of doing the baptistery gates in Florence; but he was destined to see the goldsmith Ghiberti win his place. Della Quercia had splendid consolation, however, for the great central doors of Bologna cathedral, San Pe\u00ac tronio, have made him duly famous and brought him lasting honor. We greatly enjoyed the paintings of Francia and Lorenzo Costa in the Oratorio of Santa Cecilia, but I much prefer the Francia pictures.

During the Middle Ages the Bolognese were made subject for a time to different local and foreign families\u2014the Pepoli, the Zambeccari, the Milan despots, Visconti; later the city was subdued and ruled by the Bentivoglio family; finally, tired of oppression, the people of the town \"jumped from the frying-pan into the fire\" and gave themselves over to the Church, against which they re- belled frequently, but were freed from papal subjection only when Napoleon I united Bologna to the kingdom of Italy.

One recalls here, too, Goethe\u2019s charm- ing picture of this celebrated court of Ferrara; but many romances which are given the halo of history by brilliant and ingenious authors are not based upon fact; and there seems to be little foundation for the attachment of Tasso to Eleonora, the youngest un- married sister of the Duke. It was here at Ferrara that Lorenzo Costa (1460- 1535) was born, though his study and work was largely directed by Francesco Francia, the chief master of the Bolognese school.

They engaged in extensive commerce with the East, and the wealth and importance of the family may be gathered from the fact that in 1379 no less than fifty-nine Morosini subscribed toward the fund for carrying on the war of Chioggia. The House of Morosini gave four Doges to Venice, and numbered among its honors two Royal marriages, two Cardinals, twenty-four Procurators of Saint Mark, besides numer- ous generals of the Republic.

It was at the time when the ambition of Louis XIV excited troubles all over Europe, so that the envious of Venice were so busy with their own difficulties, and the Republic knew so well how to preserve its own neutrality, that these years of European warfare were for Venice a period of profound peace. But the continued enmity of Turkey menaced Venice, which already was financially weakened after the great single-handed fight she had carried on for so many years against the East. At this crisis the Senate called Francesco Morosini to command the fleet, a post in which he covered himself with glory by his bold offensive operations in the Peloponnesus. For fourteen years the contest was bravely maintained on both sides, but the fortune of war was against the Turks. The Venetians not only occupied the Morea, but laid siege to Athens, Morosini bombarding the Parthenon, which had been made a powder magazine. lhe campaigns, which were renewed every spring, were marked by a series of victories; Prevesa, Nava\u00ac rino, Modone, Argos, Lepanto, and Corinth \u2014 all added glory to the name of Morosini, who was then called \u201cIl Peloponnesiaco.

Perhaps it is because the lake lies a little to one side of the beaten path of travel, that one hears it less spoken of than the other Italian lakes, but certainly it is beautiful, set like a deep sapphire, in the midst of the great mountains that 12551                                ",

The Villa of Pratolino is perhaps the most famous and beautiful of all the villas about Florence, and belonged formerly to the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. The ch\u00e2teau was built by Buontalenti about 1569, at the instance of the Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici, the instance of the Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici, to serve as the home of his bride, Bianca Cappello, that beautiful Venetian about whom so many stories and legends have been written. We passed the colos- sal crouching figure that is supposed to represent the Apennines, and recalled the famous legend of the Bianca\u2019s leopard; certainly the portrait by Bron- the Bianca\u2019s leopard; certainly the portrait by Bron- zino that we saw yesterday in the Pitti gallery, and another to-day in the villa, would indicate that there was no exaggeration in the much-famed beauty of this extraordinary woman. The daughter of a Vene- tian noble, Bartolomeo Cappello, and said to be the beauty of Venice, she had run away with a young Venetian, not of noble birth. Her name was scratched from the lists of the Venetian patricians, and after a time the Duchy of Venice demanded from Flor- a time the Duchy of Venice demanded from Flor- ence the extradition of the runaway couple.

After her death the fame of this strange and alto- gether lovable woman grew much more than ever before, and when Siena gave \u00c6neas Piccolomini to the papacy as Pius II, although she had been wor\u00ac shipped without any formal authorization of the Church, she was now duly canonized as a saint by a Bull that raised her to the honors of the altar. She has left a very complete and interesting picture of herself in her letters. The spot where she took her first vows is shown in a chapel, a relic of the ancient church zealously preserved because of its historical associations, most of which centre around the saint.

In the fourteenth century Ranieri, Bishop of Viterbo. built a hunting lodge for himself around Bagnaja, where he came to hunt the hawk. The little lodge is now used as the stable, and the arms of the old bishop may still be traced through the whitewash. Cardinal di Gambara, inspired by and doubtless envious of the di Gambara, inspired by and doubtless envious of the beautiful villa of the Cardinal of Este at Tivoli, and the magnificent castle-villa of Caprarola, determined to emulate these luxurious leaders of the Church by building for himself a villa near Viterbo, where he was at this time elected to the bishopric (1566). He for\u00ac tunately secured the services of Vignola, the greatest of villa architects who, born in 1507, developed his talents just when the glory of the villa life was at its height. He lived at nearly the same time, though somewhat earlier than Palladio, and these two men completed the early Renaissance. Vignola, from long and loving study of classic art, believed little else worthy of attention, and the twin villas of Lante are simple in line, but so beautiful in their perfect propor- tion and soft gray coloring, that one easily furnishes the whole scheme in the imagination. Although many writers on villas and garden architecture of Italy have asserted that the two separate houses of the Villa Lante were designedly built to make a complete whole of garden beauty, I understood Duke Lante to say that the original plan of the villa was intended to be very similar to the present Villa Medici at Rome, as I can show you by the photographs.

The Cardinal\u2019s conscience troubled him, the reproof was heeded, and accordingly a hospital was built in Viterbo, and large sums devoted to the cathedral, while the cen- tral part of the villa was left unfinished.

Its oval basin and the precipitous wooded slopes of tufa and lava that sur\u00ac round it, almost prove that it was once the actual crater of a volcano. As laya is the best possible fertilizer for vines, these heights surrounding the lake have long been cultivated, and produce wine that looks like molten gold; its taste is not secondary to its beauty, as we proved to-day, when Donna Eugenia served it at luncheon, telling us with evident pleasure that it had been made on her estates. The lake is apparently fed by a subterranean spring, and it has been discovered that the bottom are two magnificent Roman galleys thought to date from the time of Caligula. In the fifteenth century many attempts were made to raise them, without suc- cess, but through the agency of divers, fragments of wood and ornamental bronzes of exquisite manufacture 1417                                  ",

About the ninth century, Donna Eugenia tells me, the place was called Massa Nemus, and was probably in the possession of the sanctuary of St. Giambattista of Albano, from which it passed to Agapito of the of Albano, from which it passed to Agapito of the Tusculum counts, and afterward to Oddone Frangi- pane. Pope Anastasius IV gave the castle and town to the Cistercian monks, who held it for some time; later it was besieged by the Caetani Pope, Boniface VIII, and given by him to Orso Orsini. In the four- teenth century it was successively ruled by the Capi- zucchi and Annibaldi families, and by the Colonna and Cardinal d\u2019Estouteville, in the fifteenth. The Borgia Pope included Nemi among the various estates that he bestowed upon his beautiful daughter Lucrezia, but after his death the Colonna again seized it. During the sixteenth century this treasured bit of nature was in turn owned by the Cesarini, Piccolomini, and Cenci in turn owned by the Cesarini, Piccolomini, and Cenci families; but in 1572 the Frangipane again became masters, and undoubtedly enlarged and amplified the castle. It remained under the control of these lords up to the time of 1781, when the castle was sold to Don Luigi Braschi (a nephew of Pius VI), who caused the walls to be adorned with the series of frescoes by Coccetti, which are very attractive for the reproduc- tions which they give of Nemi in the eighteenth cen- 1418                                  ",

Here indeed, we may really see types of the ancient Sabel- lians, for nothing can be more Italian, strictly speaking, than the towns of the Sabine Hills, among which Arsoli has been pre-eminent.

I thanked him, and we walked with him all over this wonderful garden. I took pictures of the great palm which is thought to be over a hundred years old, and rises higher than the villa itself. The walks were lined with thick masses of blooming stock of varied colors, and indeed every flower seemed to be luxuriant, and showed not only the wonderful results of sunshine and care, but the fertility of the island, of sunshine and care, but the fertility of the island, which seems a veritable garden of the gods.

A general invitation to the nations of Europe to join an inter\u00ac national conference was sent out, and fourteen countries were represented in the council which was held at Geneva in 1863. In response to the Geneva invitation, thirty-six delegates from four\u00ac teen nations of Europe \u2014 all except Turkey, Greece, Portugal, and the Papal States \u2014 assembled in the Swiss capital, where in conference it was recommended \u201cthat each government extend its sanction of authority or protection to sanitary commissions and other relief corps\"\u2019; that in time of war the privilege of neutrality be extended to ambulances, military hospitals, officials of the medical services, regulars and volunteers, to nurses and to the inhabitants in the theatre of war who should receive and care the inhabitants in the theatre of war who should receive and care for the wounded in their houses; and that the universal insignia and flag of persons, officials, and volunteers who might assist in and flag of persons, officials, and volunteers who might assist in the care of the wounded in war, and of ambulances and hospitals the care of the wounded in war, and of ambulances and hospitals in all armies, be a white flag or band with a red cross; the form of the insignia being adopted as a tribute to Switzerland, the parent country of the idea. The Swiss flag is a white cross on a red background. The United States took no part in this first conference, but the next year two American delegates were sent to tell the inter- national body of the success of the United States Sanitary Com\u00ac mission, which had been organized at the opening of the Civil War, and which had rendered valuable service to the Union army. This testimony from the United States, showing definitely the practicability of a movement similar to the proposed Red Cross, proved a helpful inspiration and encouragement to the founders of the new organization. The first American Red Cross was founded a year after the close of the Civil War, and was known as The American Association for the Relief of Miseries of Battle- fields, and it was about this time that Clara Barton first came before the public. Miss Barton was a Government clerk in Washington in 1854, [511                                          ",

After the war she organized at her own expense a search for missing soldiers, and subsequently followed the German army through the Franco-Prussian War. At its close she was decorated with the Gold Cross of Baden and the Iron Cross of Germany. It was largely through her efforts that the American Red Cross of to-day was organized in 1881 and she was its active President until 1904, when in the reorgan- ization of the Society her place was filled by no less a person than President William H. Taft. President Taft has taken the greatest interest in the organiza- tion, and by his personal influence and powerful help has rendered invaluable service not only to the American but to the Inter- national Red Cross Association. The amount of 8976,000 was expended through the American Red Cross for the Italian relief work, and the congressional appropriation was 88oo,ooo for the Italian sufferers, substantial proofs indeed of American sympathy and generosity toward Italy, that country which all men honor, admire and love.
