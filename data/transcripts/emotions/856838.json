It is not necessary to speak with any minuteness of a palace so generally visited by travellers and so often a palace so generally visited by travellers and so often described in print.

The spacious rooms, the lofty ceilings, the uncarpeted floors covered with a com\u00ac position like stone, and the small amount of furniture, all were suggestive of a climate in which the sun was avoided as an enemy, not wooed as a friend.

At every moment of the steamer\u2019s progress, magic combinations of scenery were revealed which seemed like the de- lusions of the stage. It all appeared to be made of something finer than common earth. The crew of the little steamer, with their smart caps, nice blue shirts, striped trowsers and rich red sashes, prolonged the illusion, and looked as if they were going upon the stage to sing a chorus in Masaniello. Under such dreamy influences, it was easy to people the wooded banks with satyrs and buskined wood-nymphs, and to listen for the sound of visionary horns. Cadenabbia is a mere handful of houses, so close upon the waters of the lake that their soothing ripple is the musical accompaniment to all sounds and thoughts. At a short distance from the inn, is the villa Somariva. A pretty fountain plays before the principal entrance. In the hall is the celebrated frieze by Thorswalden, representing the triumphs of Alexander, a work worthy of the best days of Grecian art; also a Palamedes and of the best days of Grecian art; also a Palamedes and a Cupid and Psyche by Canova, which do not bear a Cupid and Psyche by Canova, which do not bear the comparison provoked by their proximity.

This game is played by two persons who place themselves opposite to each other, and each, at the same moment, throws out his right hand with a certain number of fingers extended, and a certain number closed or shut upon the palm; and each player, as the hand descends, shrieks out the number made by adding his antagonist\u2019s open fingers to his own. Each one, of course, knows how many fingers he extends himself, but those of his adversary must be caught during the lightning descent of his hand. He who names the right number makes a point in the game. When both are right or both wrong, it is a tie and no point is made. The fingers of the left hand, which is held back, serve to mark the points. This a popular game all over Italy, suiting, as it does, the indolent habits and passionate temperament of the people. Simple as it seems, it requires great quickness of eve to play it well, and there are degrees of excellence among players, as in whist or cricket.

Three days upon the Italian lakes, a period far too short, were enough however to stamp impressions upon the memory, which can never be effaced. Florence and Rome exert their powerful attraction over the traveller, as soon as he puts his foot upon the soil of Italy ; but let him resist their spell awhile and linger around these magic shores. He will find nothing more beautiful till he comes to Naples. Indeed, these lakes bear the same relation to the rest of Italy that Italy itself does to the rest of Europe. All that is most characteristic of the scenery of the country is here found in the highest perfection. Mountains pr\u00e9\u00ac cipitous in form and grand in outline, the foreground smoothed and softened by the richest cultivation, white villas peeping through the twinkling foliage of the vine, the maize, the olive, and the chestnut, make such combinations as the artist loves, while in the terraced gardens, the hedges of myrtle and the walls of orange and lemon plead, and not in vain, in behalf of the formal and artificial horticulture which they embellish. The people that dwell around these lakes seem of soft and pliant mould, finding their life in agreeable sensations rather than resolute effort; roused from their repose by the flash of passion rather than the spur of enterprise.

The stranger in Milan naturally hurries to the cele\u00ac brated cathedral, a structure the merits and demerits of which require an architectural eye to comprehend and interpret. I can only say that its exterior was some\u00ac what disappointing. When we hear of a building of white marble, we expect something more overpowering and dazzling than any reality can be. Built as the cathedral has been at wide intervals of time, its sur\u00ac face presents different shades of color which disturb the simplicity and uniformity which so large a mass requires. From the nature of a material so tempting to the chisel there results a crowd of detail which in like manner impairs the general impression. It seems like a piece of jewellers\u2019 work magnified a million of times. Stone which does not attract attention to its color and surface seems best adapted to carry out the idea of Gothic architecture. Viewing the Milan ca- thedral from a distance, it struck me as wanting height in proportion to its breadth. The interior, always excepting the disingenuous trick of the painted ceiling, called forth only unquali\u00ac fied admiration. The spirit of criticism falls prostrate and powerless before the visible sublime, embodied in such massive pillars, in a roof so airy and majestic. all shrouded in that dim religious light which hallows all shrouded in that dim religious light which hallows every object upon which it falls. Surely, if we could bring home but one thing from Europe, that one thing should be a cathedral.

Raised far above a crowd of subordi- nate peaks, buttressed by enormous glaciers, crowned with a dazzling diadem of eternal snow, he towers aloft, the emperor of the monarch mountains around him. All this may be seen and enjoyed, without fatigue and without danger, in a comfortable carriage and upon an excellent road. We hear much of the good, old times ; surely, there is some reason to be thankful that we live in the good, new times.

In a few moments, after walking down \u00e0 gentle descent, a sound of flowing water is heard. and the light of the torches borne by the guides gleams faintly upon a river which runs through these sunless chasms, and revisits the glimpses of day at Planina, some ten miles distant. The visiter now finds himself in a vast hall, walled and roofed by impenetrable dark- ness. Rude steps in the rock lead down to the level of the stream, which is crossed by a wooden bridge, and the ascent on the other side is made by a similar flight the ascent on the other side is made by a similar flight of steps.

The pictures of Rubens remind one of a flower garden, glittering with dew, in a June morning; those of Titian are like one of our a June morning; those of Titian are like one of our own golden sunsets in autumn, seen through a thick screen of scarlet maples. In Rubens, coloring is more of an external charm; in Titian, more of an essential of an external charm; in Titian, more of an essential quality. It is a compliment to a picture to say of it that it produces the impression of the actual sc\u00e8ne. In Venice, the paintings of Titian and of the Venetian artists generally, exact from the traveller a yet higher tribute, for the hues and forms around him constantly remind him of their works.

The early Venetians drew their Roman strength and vigor from the wolf's milk of poverty and struggle. Huddled together on a cluster of islands, the necessity of obtaining all the articles of consumption from the mainland, made them sailors and boatmen. It has been said with more point than truth, that the only natural products of Massachu- setts are granite and ice ; but it is strictly true of Venice, that the only exchangable commodities which they had to start with, were fish and salt. On this slender capital they began business. From this minute seed there grew a tree of commerce, whose branches overshadowed the earth. The struggle with difficulties, which began in their cradle, was never intermitted. At all times they were obliged to maintain a vigorous contest against the hos\u00ac tile energies of nature.

SCIENCE AND LITERATURE IN VENICE. The history of Venice has been rather a favorite study of late years, and the merits and defects of its administration are generally understood. Montesquieu has stated, that virtue is the principle of a democracy, and honor of a monarchy. Of the Venetian aristoc- racy, fear was the principle which, wielded and guided ably and unscrupulously, maintained for centuries a system essentially false and bad, and which did not rest on either of the natural supports of political power, property, or numbers. Hallam,f in a few admirable paragraphs, has exposed the character of a govern\u00ac ment which, even more than that of Sparta, sacrificed the individual to the state, and his wise and generous the individual to the state, and his wise and generous judgment will command the assent of every candid mind. The influence of the constitution of Venice upon the intellectual development of its people, pre\u00ac sents some interesting points of inquiry. To state this * This view is not inconsistent with the well-known fact, that the level of the sea rises at Venice at the rate of about three inches in a century.

I con\u00ac fess that as I saw this noble railway, spanning the lagoon with its two hundred and twenty-two arches, it seemed to me all the grander from its very incon- gruity. It was an artery by which the living blood of to-day is poured into the exhausted frame of Venice. Venice \u2019is the beautiful legacy of a past age ; an age of pictures, palaces, and cathedrals, when life, like a flower-garden, ran more to ornament than to use, and was more made up of exhilarating sensations than of homely duties. The railroad is one of the symbols of a new civilization, in which wealth and genius are a new civilization, in which wealth and genius are spent in lightening the burdens of common life ; the growth of an age of schools, hospitals and almshouses, in which the privileges of the few are giving ground in which the privileges of the few are giving ground before the rights of the many. Here these two forms of civilization meet and blend like the light of day- of civilization meet and blend like the light of day- light, and of evening, in the western sky. Old memo- ries are twined with fresh and budding hopes. The railway not only connects Venice with the mainland, but the past and the future. It is an ennobling thought that the spirit of man is ever young, and that if it has that the spirit of man is ever young, and that if it has ceased to speak in cathedrals and campaniles, it is vet vocal in railways, tubular bridges and magnetic telegraphs. The productive power of nature, as it is differenced by space, shows itself in pine-trees or in palms; and from the teeming brain of man there springs in one age a gondola, in another, a steamer ; at one in one age a gondola, in another, a steamer ; at one period, a Cologne Cathedral, at another, a Menai Bridge.

In Verona there are two things to be seen ; one by the eye and one by the mind; the former is the am- the eye and one by the mind; the former is the am- phitheatre, and the latter, Romeo and Juliet. The amphitheatre is interesting from the excellent preserva\u00ac tion in which the interior still continues, thanks to the assiduous care with which it has been watched and re\u00ac paired.

The idea of an amphitheatre is simply that of a build\u00ac ing, in which he who is the most distant, in a horizontal line, shall have the highest place. This the way in which a crowd, on any occasion of interest, dispose themselves. Those who are nearest sit or lie down; those who are less near, stand; and those who are most distant climb upon trees or fences. Such an arrangement is favorable to the ear as well as to the eye. A speaker should never be above his audience. The best model for a building to speak in, is that fur\u00ac nished by a cup or bowl, in which the speaker shall stand in the bottom, and the hearers be disposed around the sides and the rim. A New England church, with the pulpit at one end, and stuck half way up the 1. wall, is the worst of all arrangements for the voice. The amphitheatre is still used for public exhibitions. 1 hope no lover of the past will be shocked when I confess that I could not help thinking what a capital place it would be for a political caucus, or a mass meeting.

There is no necessary and inev\u00ac itable relation between the beautiful scenes of the visible world, and moral well-being or well-doing, but it is cer- tainly true that just so far as a man cultivates a taste for nature, he cultivates a susceptibility to moral im\u00ac pressions.

But, as we look at them, we cannot help asking ourselves whether it would not have been better, on the whole, that they had never been painted.

Too much has been attempted, and the zeal of the builders has cooled, or their resources have fallen short, before the vision of or their resources have fallen short, before the vision of beauty or grandeur has been completed.

In the first place, we are inclined to ask, why did an artist of such prodigious inventive power place two works, so similar in conception and design, so near each other?

Much of this enthusiasm is to be ascribed to the fact that the works of Cimabue were so much superior to those of his immediate predecessors, that painting in his hands seemed like the revival of a lost art. It was not merely that the sentiment of devotion and the sense of beauty were appealed to with a power unknown be- fore, but the national pride of the people was gratified, and stirring hopes for the future awakened.

This Palazzo is a singular structure, built in a rambling and uncouth style ; and now used as a prison. Upon the walls of the Cortile are seen the armorial bearings of a long line of magistrates of Florence. The room in which the portrait was discovered had lost the aspect of a chapel, and had been used as a store- house for the prison, or some similar office.

In Fiesole, as in most Italian towns, there are churches and a convent, in which are doubtless many things worthy of being seen ; but the traveller, unless he can spend much more time than I had at my dis- posal, will hardly linger under any roof, while so en- chanting a prospect tempts him without. Language breaks down in the effort to fix upon paper the impres\u00ac sions awakened by a landscape of such beauty, such variety, and such extent. A genius like that of Byron, from which words flash with the sudden and illumining power of lightning, or of Shelley, who paints with a pen dipt in the rainbow, can alone fasten the scene and arrest the emotions to which it gives birth.

Here are several paint\u00ac ings in oil and fresco, some of them of considerable merit; and a small cloister glazed with beautiful stained glass from the designs of Giovano da Udine, illustrating events in the life of St. Bruno, showing great purity of feeling and delicacy of touch. In the refectory is an elaborately carved stone pulpit. But the most inter\u00ac esting part of the whole is a subterranean chapel, in which is the tomb of the founder Niccolo Acciajuolo, by Orgagna, a work of the fourteenth century.

These works are particu- larly interesting from the details of the costume, which are very faithfully rendered. In the same chapel is another monument, to a bishop, of the same family, by Donatello, an elaborate piece of sculpture in bas-relief with a rich border of fruit and flowers. In the principal chapel there are some good pictures, and a beautiful floor of porphyry, jasper, and verd antique. The cells of the monks are small detached houses, spacious and comfortable, with trim gardens attached to them. This extensive establishment is now occupied by only eighteen monks, and though every thing is kept in good order, there was an obvious air of decling in good order, there was an obvious air of declining fortunes around the whole. A deep silence, like that of the grave, brooded over the scene. The only sound that was heard was the play of a fountain the open space around which the cloisters ran, and there was a touch of melancholy, even in its murmur and move\u00ac ment. It was like the last child in a nursery, playing by itself. The monk who attended me was dressed in a flowing robe of white woollen. He was in the in a flowing robe of white woollen.

He was evi\u00ac dently one of those commonplace persons in whom the wrongs of the monastic system are most distinctly the wrongs of the monastic system are most distinctly seen. Minds that can draw deeply, either from the fountains of genius, or the cisterns of learning, can endure solitude without sinking into torpor. So, a spirit sublimed into ecstasy by religious enthusiasm can bear it, for all absorbing passions sustain the mind which they consume. In either case, interest and companionship are supplied from unfailing sources. But a man of an average understanding and a com- monplace temperament, shut up in a monastic estab\u00ac lishment, turns in time into a human vegetable. Light is not more essential to the eye than is the discipline of is not more essential to the eye than is the discipline of life to such men. They need occupation, the alterna\u00ac tion of hope and fear, the glow of success, the sharp\u00ac ness of defeat, the attrition of chance and change; and above all, the family affections, to train them up to their just stature. The wing of an eagle does not more presuppose the medium of the atmosphere to play in, than does the nature of man demand the relations of son, brother, friend, husband, and father. My poor monk seemed to me a wingless bird. Monastic insti- tutions have had their day. They have done their work, and it was a good work in its season. It is now unseasonable, and therefore not good.

It is an ungrateful return for hospitable attentions, to print the conversation of your host, or describe his person, or give an inventory of his furniture, or proclaim how his wife and daughters were dressed.

A happier home and a more perfect union than theirs, it is not easy to imagine; and this com\u00ac pleteness arises not only from the rare qualities which each possesses, but from their adaptation to each other. Browning\u2019s conversation is like the poetry of Chaucer, or like his own, simplified and made trans- parent. His countenance is so full of vigor, freshness, and refined power, that it seems impossible to think that he can ever grow old. His poetry is subtle, passionate, and profound ; but he himself is simple, natural, and playful. He has the repose of a man who has lived much in the open air; with no nervous uneasiness and no unhealthy self-consciousness. Mrs. Browning is in many respects the correlative of her husband.

A group of youths and maidens amusing themselves in a garden, with the angel of death hovering over them with a scythe, is overflowing with the expression of light-hearted mirth and joyous unconcern ; and with equal power, the artist has rep- resented a company of the maimed, blind, and diseased, vainly entreating the grim presence to end their suffer- ings. The whole composition reminds one of the mys\u00ac teries or miracle-plays of the middle ages. The Baptistery is a circular building of white marble, about a hundred feet in diameter. The exterior pre- sents a singular combination of Grecian and Gothic elements. \u2019There are two orders of Corinthian col- umns, the lower being twenty in number, and engaged in the wall, and the upper, sixty ; all supporting semi\u00ac in the wall, and the upper, sixty ; all supporting semi\u00ac circular arches.

Above the pediments, surmounting the second order of columns, the circular figure ends, and the building becomes a polygon of twenty sides, each of which terminates with a pediment between two clusters of pinnacles, which conceal the base of the dome.' From this discrepancy in the style, it has been conjec\u00ac tured that the building was the work of different archi\u00ac tects, and erected at different periods.

We reached Rome at midnight, entering it by the Porta Cavalleggieri, in the immediate neighborhood of St. Peter\u2019s. The night was dark and stormy, and just before reaching the gate the clouds gathered for a storm of thunder and lightning, which lasted for a considerable time. As we drove by St. Peter\u2019s, the dome and colonnade were revealed by gleams of lightning and then shrouded in gloom, and the dash of its fountains was heard mingled with the pattering of the heavy rain-drops. Amid this war of the elements we passed by the Castle of St. Angelo, over the bridge, and through the narrow streets that lead to the Piazza di Spagna; and I felt that it was under no inappropriate conditions, that I was first brought face to face with the grandeur and mystery of the Eternal City.

These comprised, of course, a great variety of opin\u00ac ions and suggestions. The great point of difference was, ions and suggestions. The great point of difference was, whether the obelisk should be removed in an upright position as it then stood, or whether it should first be lifted from the pedestal and laid upon the ground. Most of the plans were in favor of the former method; but Fontana zealously maintained the expediency of the latter. The pope required him to make the expediency of the latter. The pope required him to make an experiment of his scheme of transportation, upon a small an experiment of his scheme of transportation, upon a small obelisk formerly belonging to the Mausoleum of Augustus. This proved entirely successful ; and the execution of the en\u00ac terprise was entrusted to him by a papal edict, dated October 5, 1585. The great difficulty in the removal arose from the enormous weight of the obelisk, which was nearly a million of pounds. On the 30th of April, 1586, this immense mass was slowly and successfully lifted two feet above its pedestal, by the strength of nine hundred men, aided by thirty-five windlasses. It re- mained thus suspended in the air till the 7th May, when, by the same agency, the still more difficult task of swinging it the same agency, the still more difficult task of swinging it sideways out of its perpendicular position, and laying it upon rollers placed on the ground to receive it, was also happily executed.

CHRISTMAS IN ST. PETER'S. The services in St. Peter\u2019s on Christmas day, in 1847, were attended by an immense concourse of people. Rome was at that time thronged by strangers from all parts of the world, and the zeal and interest of the native population were awakened anew by the universal enthusiasm inspired by Pius IX., at that time at the height of his short-lived popularity. It was indeed rather idolatry than popularity; and the wild hopes which he made to blossom in the susceptible hearts of his people, were such as neither the highest capacity nor the most favorable opportunities could have ripened into fruit. At an early hour on that day I found the church already occupied by a great crowd. A double row of soldiers stretched from the entrance to the altar, around which the pope\u2019s guards in their fantastic uniform, like the figures in a pack of in their fantastic uniform, like the figures in a pack of cards, were stationed : and a number of ladies sat in a sort of box on either side, dressed in black, in a sort of box on either side, dressed in black, their heads covered with veils.

Rome was for many generations the capital of the world. It was to the rest of the earth what Paris now is to France. Talent of all kinds was attracted to this central heart; and every aspiring artist felt that his reputation was provincial until it had received the imperial stamp of Rome. Here, too, flowed the wealth of the world ; and the immense revenues of the patricians were expended in the luxuries of archi\u00ac tecture and horticulture, in sculpture and painting. The gold which had been wrung from the African, the Gaul, or the Briton, stimulated the chisel of the artist whose early taste had been formed by the frieze of the Parthenon. By whatever hands the works in the Vatican may have been wrought, the spirit of the collection is Greek. Indeed, until the time of Michael Angelo all sculpture was essentially Greek. In art, the Ro- all sculpture was essentially Greek. In art, the Ro- mans had no Lucretius and no \u2019Juvenal. We see various degrees of merit, but the merit is all of one class. Other things being equal, he who is most familiar with Greek literature is best prepared to profit by a visit to the galleries of the Vatican. The books and the statues illustrate each other.

Foremost among them, and placed by general con\u00ac sent at the head of all the oil-paintings in the world, is the Transfiguration, by Raphael. As is well known, is the Transfiguration, by Raphael.

The picture has been criticised for its twofold ac- tion, which, it is said, makes of it, in reality, two pictures instead of one. But the subject necessarily involves two elements, the divine and the human, in order to give it completeness. The spectacle of the transfiguration would have been no more than a splen- did vision, but for the connection thus established be\u00ac tween the Saviour\u2019s glorified state and the sufferings of humanity, which were in him to find healing and relief. The contrasts afforded by such a subject- calling forth the two principles of worship and sym- pathy \u2014 were peculiarly suited to Raphael\u2019s genius, which was reverential, tender, and sensitive ; and it is evident that he never threw more of his own individu- ality into any of his works than into this, and that no one is on the whole more characteristic. The lower part of the picture is full of animation and expression, without any taint of bustle or carica\u00ac ture.

In the upper part of the picture, the figure and head of the Saviour, in point of coloring, drawing, and expression, are among the very highest achievements of the art of painting. The dignity and serenity with which the form reposes on the air are a distinct expression of Divine power; and the light with which it is penetrated is also celestial. A painter like Correggio, a great master of light and shade, would have been tempted to make this element too prominent, and thus have to make this element too prominent, and thus have impaired the sentiment of the picture by a sort of theatrical contrast, involving wonders of technical skill.

Certain distinctions are univer- sally recognized, but individual preferences, from simple variety of temperament, are capriciously en\u00ac tertained, and often rest upon no other reason than that they are felt. This picture by Domenichino is a remarkable in- stance of what may be accomplished without great natural genius ; for this excellent painter was not born to that inheritance. I have always regarded the harsh language in which the author of the * Modern Painters speaks of Domenichino, as very unjust, and as showing an eccentricity of taste (to say the least) beyond any an eccentricity of taste (to say the least) beyond any thing else contained in that daring and suggestive book. Ruskin sets so high value upon imagination in art, that he is not fair to unimaginative artists ; and of all emi\u00ac nent painters Domenichino is, perhaps, the least imagi\u00ac native. Conscientious, laborious, self-distrustful, of simple and retired tastes and mild temper, he made himself a painter by study, observation, and experi- ment. The fire of genius never burns along his lines; but skill, taste, correctness, judgment, and decorum always wait upon his pencil. The Communion of St. Jerome is not an ideal work. It is remarkable more than any thing else, for its truth and powerful reality. The emaciated form of the Dying Saint is painted with a painful fidelity to nature.

The religious character of this chapel, in the view of Protestants at least, is quite lost in the admiration awakened for that immortal artist who has left here such wonderful monuments of his genius. It seems really dedicated to Michael Angelo, and he is the pre- siding divinity of the place. The popes who em\u00ac ployed him here for so many years could hardly have anticipated such a result. That was not an age of hero-worship, and art yet continued to draw its life- blood from the spirit of religion.

Looking at these works merely in a critical point of view, it is not possible to give them too high praise. There is hardly any excellence of which the art of painting is capable, which may not be found here in the highest perfection : drawing, composition, expres\u00ac sion, dignity of sentiment, depth of feeling, and grace of movement.

But when we turn to the domestic groups between the prophets and the sibyls and in the arches over the windows, and espe- cially to the various infantile figures which support and adorn the architectural portions of the design, we see that softer and gentler aspect which it so rarely assumed, that but for these very compositions we should hardly have supposed him capable of putting it on.

Christianity could not destroy, without at the same time recon\u00ac structing. The instinct of reverence, already formed, was to be diverted to higher and purer objects. The links of association, already woven, were not to be rudely snapped, but to be gently unwound, and at- tached to new forms. Christianity addressed, with more authoritative voice and higher sanctions, the religious principle \u2014 the sentiment of worship \u2014 in the heart of man ; but to this, Paganism had also ap\u00ac pealed, and upon this it had rested.

The exquisite skill with which the apostle Paul, in his ad\u00ac dress to the Athenians, availed himself of the religious instincts of his hearers, as a foundation which to rear the nobler faith which he brought; and the tact with which he made these instincts a starting point from which to soar to a purer region \u2014 have been often noticed with admiration. Thus, the early preachers of Christianity were obliged to use a persuasive and con- ciliatory tone, whenever they approached a polished and 'intellectual community, and to admit that God had not, in times past, utterly hidden his face from his children. These obvious considerations should modify the \u00e9x\u00ac treme severity of tone into which Protestant writers are apt to fall, whenever they notice any resemblance between the ceremonies of the Church of Rome and the rites of Paganism. The temples in Rome were not adapted to the uses of Christian worship. With the ancients, worship was a ceremony addressed to the ey\u00eb, in which the priest a ceremony addressed to the ey\u00eb, in which the priest was the performer, and the people were the spectators. Hence, in the ancient temples the architectural splen\u00ac dor is on the exterior, and the interior is simple and unadorned. Sacrifices, also, formed a large part of religious observances among the ancients, and these consisted principally of burnt meats : an opening at the top was therefore necessary that the powerful odor the top was therefore necessary that the powerful odor might not be too offensive. This undoubtedly the explanation of the open dome of the Pantheon. But Christian worship was spiritual in its character, and social in its form.

Thus, when Christianity became the dominant faith, and large audiences began to gather round its teachers, the old temples were found not to be suited for the purposes of churches. But there was a class of buildings which, in their plan and construction, were admirably adapted to the requisitions of Christian worship ; and these were the basilicas. Without going into the learning, historical or archi\u00ac tectural, of this subject, it is enough to say, that a basilica, in its primitive sense, was that part of a royal residence in which the monarch, either in person or by deputy, transacted the business of his office. It was to compare great things with small \u2014 like the hall in which an English country gentleman and justice of the peace hears complaints against vagrants and poachers. In Rome, this appellation was applied to those build\u00ac ings erected, usually in the forum, for the transaction of judicial business ; in which the pr\u00e6tor heard causes and received complaints ; and for this purpose its plan and proportions wer\u00ea admirably adapted. The form of the basilica is, indeed, one of the natural and inevitable the basilica is, indeed, one of the natural and inevitable forms of architecture. As the problem how to dispose of a crowd in such a way, that the greatest number of persons possible may see the same thing at the same time, is solved by the amphitheatre ; so the arrange\u00ac ments of a basilica are precisely those which will best enable the magistrates forming a court of justice to hear causes, to deliberate upon them, to pronounce\u2019their de\u00ac cision, and at the same time give to suitors, advocates, and the public, their fair share of accommodation.

Outside of, and on either hand of these columns, a wall was reared, of in\u00ac ferior height, and attached to the columns by a lean-to roof, and leaving a space above for air and light to enter, between the capitals of the columns. These side structures were divided into an upper and lower part. At the end of the rectangle, opposite the entrance, was the tribunal for the magistrates, rectangular or circular, the tribunal for the magistrates, rectangular or circular, sometimes on the same level with the general floor, and sometimes raised above it. Thus, we have seats for presiding magistrates, an open space in front for parties and their advocates, a gallery for the accommodation of the public, and side passages to pass in and out. A portico was generally added in front. The early Christian churches, borrowing the name of the basilica, imitated with very little change its form and arrangements, putting the altar in the place occu\u00ac pied by the tribunal. By some writers it has been surmised that this was because the bishops and priests were regarded as clothed with the power of adminis\u00ac tering spiritual justice in the form of rebuke or pen\u00ac ance, but the fact is sufficiently explained by the fitness of the basilica for the purposes of public worship, with\u00ac of the basilica for the purposes of public worship, with\u00ac out going in search of any more recondite motives.

The modern basilicas have undergone considerable changes, but they retain the essential features of the altar, the nave, and the side aisles, to vindicate their origin and descent.

When a statue becomes too expressive, it ceases to be statuesque and begins to be picturesque. Before the idea of the Saviour, or even of the Virgin, sculpture drops, or ought to drop its chisel in reverential awe. The venerable forms of saints and martyrs are not ideal enough for its pur\u00ac poses. And as for angels, the wings present great difficulties. Cut out of marble, and stuck upon the shoulders where there are no muscles to moye or sup\u00ac port them, they become unsightly excrescences. The angels of our visions float, and speed on their errands of blessing by their power of will alone, without mech- of blessing by their power of will alone, without mech- anism or muscle. In the Church of Sta. Maria sopra Minerva is a full\u00ac length statue of Christ by Michael Angelo; a work, admirable so far as the handling of the marble is con- cerned, but by no means successful in overcoming the essential difficulties of the subject. In the Church of Sta.

The whale is hardly larger than the man: a disproportion explained by the fact that the subject was early chosen by Christian artists as a type of the resurrection, and was meant to be a symbol, and not a representation. For the same reason, the prophet appears in the bloom of youth. Its merit as a work of art is more than respectable. The block from which the statue is carved, is said to have fallen from the so-called temple of Jupiter Stator, in the Forum. 23 VOL. I.                                    ",

Upon the decay of the house, a church was built on the site in the ninth cen\u00ac tury.

Thus, without the celibacy of the Roman clergy, we could not have had the palaces and villas of Rome and its vicinity, for most of them were built by cardinals or popes, and from the revenues of the church. They form marked points of interest and attraction, and are among the peculiar and characteristic features of the Eternal City. The distinction between a palace and a villa does not depend upon situation, for though there are no palaces without the walls, yet there are villas are no palaces without the walls, yet there are villas within them. A villa is a palace with a garden. A palace is a villa without a garden. The Roman palaces, mostly of later date than those of Florence, are of a more shewy style of architecture; of Florence, are of a more shewy style of architecture; and they differ more among themselves.

New palaces are built, in which the taste of powerful patrons demands the attractions of novelty. Architects like Ammanati and Pirro Ligorio, confident in themselves, and unwilling to move in paths which others had opened, aimed at more shewy effects and more strik- ing combinations. In their designs, however, there is so much genius and inventive power, that the results which they produce are worthy of great praise ; and faults in detail are overlooked in the dazzling effective\u00ac ness of the whole.

The line of the cornice is so broken and interrupted, that the building seems to rest upon a yielding foundation, or to have been strained by an earthquake. In the eighteenth century, so few works were constructed that no distinct character in architecture can be assigned to it. The Consulta and Corsini Palaces, built by Fuga, were im\u00ac provements upon some of their predecessors, and the Palazzo Braschi, the newest of all, erected at the close of the last century, has the finest staircase in Rome. Of late years, so far as can be judged from the little that has been done, architecture seems to have been under the guidance of a better taste. Classical models, especially, have been much studied under the influence of Canina, a practical architect, profoundly versed in of Canina, a practical architect, profoundly versed in the learning of his profession ; and there is a growing the learning of his profession ; and there is a growing disposition to return to the regularity of classical forms.

Cardinal Antonio Barberini, by whom ample funds were bestowed upon the college. The building occu- pied by the institution in the Piazza di Spagna, a capricious and irregular piece of architecture, was erected by Urban VIII. from the plans partly of Ber- nini and partly of Boromini. It includes the palace once occupied by Vives, a Spanish prelate and ambas\u00ac sador, who bequeathed his whole fortune to the estab- lishment. At the breaking out of the French Revolution, this foundation, enriched by the bounty of devout Catholics all over Christendom, was one of the most powerful and wealthy in Europe. It enjoyed an annual income of three hundred thousand Roman crowns. It appealed to the unconverted by the written as well as the spoken word. Its printing-office was one of the finest in the world, and had the means of publishing books in twen- ty-seven different languages.

He was told that no one recalled their homes with longing, or a desire to return, but those who went back most gladly were the natives of Lebanon, Switzerland, and Scotland ; even religious devotedness not being sufficient to efface the love of home, when that home is among mountains.

They were generally very short, rarely exceeding five minutes ; and as soon as one had concluded he was instantly followed by his as one had concluded he was instantly followed by his successor, so that no time was lost. Several of the exercises in the oriental tongues were concluded by a few strains of singing or chanting, which afforded much amusement to the spectators.
