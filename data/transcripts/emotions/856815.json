A few white cottages were the most interesting objects in this verdant desert; but after some difficulty in finding access to them through the bogs, we were denied reception, and compelled to bivouac amidst malaria and musquitoes. At three in the morning we roused our boatmen (who seemed more content with their birth) and put to sea. After frequent ineffectual struggles against the wind, we were forced to return and advance by inland canals, until towards evening we launched across the fine broad bay to Grado.

The inter\u00ac course being chiefly with Oriental merchants, she renders quarantine as mild as possible.

As we are on the point of quitting Dalmatia, it may not be ill placed to make some remarks on that singular race, which form its population, on that singular race, which form its population, and are perhaps the wildest people of Europe. The Morlaques, notwithstanding the rude\u00ac ness of their appearance, and the thousand stories that are circulated of them, always ap- peared to me to be a people naturally affable, and when so, certainly sincere. Their industry is as invincible as the aspect of their soil is un\u00ac is as invincible as the aspect of their soil is un\u00ac inviting; but their labours are much impeded, and their hopes cruelly blighted, by those moun- tain robbers of whom I before spoke, and whose vicinity cause even the more peaceable to go armed. The mills of the Morlaques, though I do not feel myself mechanic enough to describe them, seemed ingenious contrivances, borrowed. they say, from the Turks. Some picturesque buildings of this kind I saw at Scardona and Sa\u00ac lona. The Morlaques are in general a race of stout and almost gigantic form; and if theirspirit, wild as their native rocks, could submit to dis\u00ac                            ",
