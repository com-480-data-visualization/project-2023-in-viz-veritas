But the favourable opi\u00ac nion of Those, to whom some of the other LETTERS had been occasionally communi\u00ac cated, encouraged the Editor to compile a small Volume, rather than a Pamphlet.

It was about six miles from Naples, near the place, where Torre del Greco stands; which village, as CLUVER assures us, is now situated on a promontory, that certainly extended farther into the sea, before this eruption of Vesuvius; which filled up the bay on the north- east, adjacent to the promontory, with ashe on the north- east, adjacent to the promontory, with ashe and stones.

He had been a kind of Preface to my Verses. He had been pleased a good while ago to let me know, that he should be glad to receive a copy of Latin Verses from me, as a proof, that I had not for\u00ac gotten the little knack of versification, which I had learned at Westminster; intimating, that it would be somewhat strange, if one, who had served more than apprenticeship to Poetry, should lose all his skill upon Classic Ground. At my parting from him, he injoined me to retain at least the little knowledge I had of Greek, La\u00ac tin, and French; directing me what books to read at my leisure hours for that purpose. And as a proper precaution, that I might not neglect his injunctions as to the two latter languages, he ordered me generally to write, either in the one, or the other. But he said not one word concern\u00ac or the other. But he said not one word concern\u00ac ing my making any Latin Verses: so that I was ing my making any Latin Verses: so that I was not a little surprized, when his demand upon me came at first to myhands; which hoping he might possibly forget to renew, I took no care to be any ",

The T twentieth degree is the highest, and implies sovereign perfection; which no man has fully arrived at. The nineteenth is the highest degree that we know; but which no person has yet gained. And the eighteenth is, for those who, in my opinion, have come nearest to per\u00ac fection; as the lower figures are for those who appear to be further from it. Thave past my judgment only on the most noted paint\u00ac ers, and in the ensuing Catalogue have divided the chief parts of the art into four columns; to wit, Compo\u00ac sition, Design, Colouring, and Expression. By Expression I mean not the character of any particular object, but the general thought of the understanding. And thus the general thought of the understanding. And thus against each painters name, we see his degree of merit in all the aforesaid four Divisions. We might introduce among the most noted painters, several Flemings, who have very falthfully shewn truth of nature, and been excellent colourists: but we thought it better to set them by themselves; because their taste was bad in other parts of the art. It now only remains to be observed, that as the essen\u00ac tial parts of painting consist of many other parts, which the same masters have not equally possessed; tis reaso\u00ac nable to set one against another, in order to make a fair judgment. Thus for instance, Composition arises from two parts; viz. Invention and Disposition. Now a paint\u00ac O VOL. I. ter ",

For the rest: Tam not so fond of my own sentiments as to think they will not be severely criticized: but T must give notice, that in order to criticize judiciously, one must have a perfect knowledge of all the parts of a piece of painting, and of the reasons which make the whole good; for many judge of a picture only by the part they like, and make no account of thse other parts, which either they do not understand, or do not relish.
