The most busy man finds some short holiday in the course of the year, and, if wise as well as busy, spends it not in quiet sojourn at some watering-place, but in active search of the picturesque, the beautiful, or the old, in nature or in art, either at home or abroad. And as the holidays of busy men are short, and therefore to be made as much of as possible, I conceive that 1 shall be rendering some service, and providing myself with a fair excuse for my presumption, if I venture to show, by a simple narrative of a tour under- taken in the course of the year before last, how much it is possible to accomplish with pleasure, and, when it is possible to accomplish with pleasure, and, when one has some definite object in view, with profit of no common kind, even in a short holiday. There are many classes of travellers, and each doubtless flatters itself that its own is the very best of all modes of travelling; and sorry should I be to of all modes of travelling; and sorry should I be to attempt to disabuse any one of so pleasant a self-deceit. But the more I think of it, the more certain it appears that the reasons and objects which always take me away from home are precisely such as make up the sum of happiness and pleasure to a traveller.

No wonder then that, with a prospect at last of a sight of Italy and Italian architecture before me, I looked forward long and anxiously for the end of summer, for that happy autumn which brings ease and relaxation to so many a wearied heart, and that when, at last, at the latter a wearied heart, and that when, at last, at the latter end of August, I found myself absolutely on my way, I was in no common degree disposed for the thorough enjoyment of all that 1 met with.

It is not only in architecture, but happily in painting also, that first principles are now studied with some determina- tion by men who command the respect of a world edu- cated hitherto admire and believe in the falsest and weakest schools of art. It was, therefore, with the desire to see how far these first principles were worked out by the architects of the middle ages in Italy, how far moreover they were developed in directions unattempted by their brethren in the North, and how far they have succeeded in leaving us really noble works for our study and admiration, that I undertook my journey. Let me say, too, at the same time, that I started without either the intention or the desire to examine at all carefully the works of the Renaissance archi- tects. For this there were many reasons\u2014among others my own unfitness by predilection and education for the task, the shortness of my time, and the fact that, as it appears to me, their works have already re- ceived as much both in the way of illustration and of description as they deserve. 1 should wish also, I must confess, in all my studies of foreign architecture, to confine myself to those buildings in which there appear to me to be the germs at least of an art true and beautiful in itself, and of service to us in our attempts to improve our own work. It does not appear to me that the works of the Italian Renaissance architects really contain this.

The same falseness of con- struction, and heaviness, coarseness, and bad grotesque- ness of ornamentation, seem ever to attend their works, together with the same contempt of simplicity, repose, and delicacy which we are so accustomed to connect with them. In short, I see but little reason to differ from the estimate which Mr. Ruskin has given of their merits in the \u201c Stones of Venice,' and what he has so well said 1 need not attempt to en- large upon. My own feeling is, that, as in the pointed arch we have not only the most beautiful, but at the same time incomparably the most convenient feature in construc- tion which has ever been, or which, I firmly believe, ever can be invented, we should not be true artists if we neglected to use it. 1 hold firmly the doctrine that no architect has any right whatever to neglect to avail himself of every im- provement in construction which the growing intelli- gence of this mechanical age can afford him; but this doctrine in no way hinders the constant employment of the pointed arch; on the contrary, it makes it necessary, because it is at once the most beautiful and the most economical way of doing the work we have the most economical way of doing the work we have to be done.

Its supporters assert that pointed architecture is so essentially the effort of a particular age, and marked by certain peculiarities so decided, as to be filled, even in its most noble works, with a kind of spirit which in this age it is vain to attempt again to evoke. The old Gothic spirit is, they say, dead, and, glorious as it was, its flight was but meteor-like, and, having passed across the horizon of the world in its rapid flight, it has sunk the horizon of the world in its rapid flight, it has sunk beyond all possibility of revival. It appears to me that those who so argue confound the accidents with the elements of the true Gothic the accidents with the elements of the true Gothic architecture of the middle ages, and mistake altogether the object which, 1 trust, most architects would pro- the object which, 1 trust, most architects would pro- pose to themselves in striving for its revival. The elements are the adoption of the best principles of construction, and the ornamentation naturally and pro- perly, and without concealment, of the construction; the accidents are, as it appears to me, the particular the accidents are, as it appears to me, the particular character which individual minds may have given to their work, the savageness, or the grotesqueness as it has been called, which is mainly to be discovered in the elaboration of particular features by some particular sculptor architect, and which in the noblest works- and, indeed, 1 might say, in most works\u2014one sees no trace of. The true Gothic architects of the middle ages had, in short, an intense love of nature grafted on an equally intense love of reality and truth, and to this it                                  ",

The medi\u00e6val architecture of Italy presents, how- ever, one further practical argument against this theory of the lovers of the round arch which they cannot, 1 of the lovers of the round arch which they cannot, 1 think, meet. It will be found in the following pages that in Italy there did not exist that distinction between the use of round and pointed arches which did exist for three centuries north of the Alps. They were content there to use whichever was most convenient, and whichever appeared to them to be most effective in its intended position. We therefore find, I might almost say invariably, round and pointed arches perpetually used in the same work, the former generally for orna- ment, the latter for construction; and the effect of this in some degree to make us lessen the rigidity with which a study of northern art might otherwise affect our views on this point. But I think no argument can be used by the lovers of the round arch which would ever go farther than to leave us open to the choice of both round and pointed arches, just as in these old Italian buildings : they have no right to say \u201c You may not use the pointed arch at all,\" but they perhaps may be allowed to ask \u201c Why exclude for ever the round arch ?\u201c and then I should refer them to Italy for a proof that as a rule the                                  ",

My object therefore in the following pages will be mainly, to show the peculiarities of the development of pointed architecture in Italy, and specially to show in what way the materials so commonly used there- \u2014 brick and marble\u2014were introduced both in decoration and in construction. All these points are of the very greatest importance to us, for I am persuaded that not only will some reference to Italian models do some- what towards the improvement of our art, but that in no matter is information more needed, and improve- ment more easy, than in the use of brick in architecture; whilst working in marble has been as yet so little practised among us, that we may almost regard it as at present unattempted, though, as I hope to show, there is no longer any reason why this should be the case. is no longer any reason why this should be the case.

XV It is impossible to conclude this preface without mention of the obligations which not only all who travel in Italy, but all who are interested in good architecture, owe to Mr. Ruskin. No man need or can profess his acquiescence in every one of the opinions which he has propounded, but as an architect I feel strongly that a great debt of gratitude is owing to him for his brilliant advocacy of many laws and truths in which every honest architect ought gladly to acquiesce. He may be well content to bear the oppo- sition which he has evoked, satisfied that all that he has written is in the main most certainly for the benefit and exaltation of art of all kinds. Nor less is a debt of gratitude to be acknowledged by every traveller to my friend Mr. Webb for his most excellent and trusty work on Continental Ecclesiology: it is certainly the most absolutely correct guide-book ever drawn up for ecclesiologists anywhere; and in travelling over the same ground, as 1 have done in this tour, my excuse for giving what 1 have in the way of descriptions of the same buildings is, that what I have written has been all with a view, beyond that of merely describing the churches, of showing the of merely describing the churches, of showing the principles upon which their builders worked, and giving, so far as the limits of such a work will allow, drawings of the buildings I have described. It will depend on circumstances whether 1 am able at some future day to continue my inquiries among the churches and domestic buildings of Central Italy, a tract at least as rich as that over which the tour a tract at least as rich as that over which the tour described in the following pages took me.

So the dress of every one, not omitting the remarkable development of their trowsers, the female policemen pre- senting arms as the train flies by, the buffets so common and generally so good, are all quite new.

Among these churches I may instance the hipped saddle-back roofed steeples of Pic- quigny, Hangest, and Pont R\u00e9my, as very valuable examples of their order; that of Picquigny, indeed, surmounting a noble early central steeple, and finished at the top with some delicate open ironwork, is about at the top with some delicate open ironwork, is about as graceful a specimen as I know. as graceful a specimen as I know. At Longpr\u00e9 is another church with a steeple of some pr\u00e9tension, but not satisfactory.

At Amiens one always longs to stop again to feast ones eyes upon its glorious cathedral, perhaps the noblest and most masculine piece of architecture in the world. But with us this was impossible; our destiny was\u2014come what might\u2014to endeavour at any rate to discharge ourselves in Paris within the promised twelve hours from London: and the dusk of the early autumn evening prevented our having more than the very slightest glimpse of the Minster.

A day in Paris may always be spent pleasantly and profitably; and under the new r\u00e9gime there is cer- tainly no lack of change and improvement in the architectural condition of the city. It is always pleasant, too, to be able to walk down the Boulevard des Italiens to the Madeleine, and for a the Boulevard des Italiens to the Madeleine, and for a few minutes to gaze at a church which certainly pre- sents one very grand idea\u2014that of space\u2014clothed in very gorgeous dress.

The last time I was at Paris I re- member, by the way, being struck here by seeing for the first time a peripteral building made use of. The walls within the columns were hung with rich dra- peries, and a long procession coming out marched round the circuit of the church between the columns and the walls, and in again at the west door; the and the walls, and in again at the west door; the effect was, as may be imagined, very striking. From the Madeleine we went to the Invalides, hop- ing to see something of the tomb of Napoleon, which ing to see something of the tomb of Napoleon, which is, I believe, just completed; but the church was partially closed, so we were fain to satisfy ourselves with the examination of an altar recently erected in a small apsidal projection from one of the side walls of the nave. The back of the apse was painted light the nave. The back of the apse was painted light blue as a relief to a kind of apotheosis of some saint, executed in the whitest-looking plaster; the figure, in the worst possible taste, with the light admitted from above, completed the thoroughly thea-                                     ",

Its design is intended to be of early character, but in reality is quite late in its effect; nor do I know when I have seen anything much less successful than the two western steeples rising but a short distance above the nave roof, and looking mean and wasted to a degree. In plan the church is not badly arranged ; there is just such a choir as might easily be properly used, and \u00e0 large space for congregational purposes. How much we want churches, in this respect at least, somewhat like S. Clothilde, in our large cities in England! The clerestory of the choir was being filled with stained glass, executed, as I understood, by a Mons. de Marischal. His windows were illustrations of a truth which men are very slow to receive and act upon, viz. that in decorating a transparent material, one whose transparency moreover is the sole cause of its use, we have no right to shade it with dark colours so far as to destroy its brilliancy. These windows were elaborately shaded, and, as a necessary conse- quence, were heavy and dismal in their effect; besides which, there were most unpleasant mixtures of green, yellow, and ruby, and of ruby and blue, very glaring and very bad.

The carving of the capitals was, very sensibly, all derived from natural types of foliage, and looked well: but the carving of rather elaborate sculptures of the c. Stations\" did not please me, having none of the severity of ancient examples. When shall we see a school of sculptors rise able really to satisfy the requirements of the times? I confess I despair more on this point than on any other ; for 1 have as yet seen on this point than on any other ; for 1 have as yet seen no fair attempt made to recover the style, or work upon the principles, of the best medi\u00e6val sculptors. The work of our modern sculptors is all foreign and unreal, and almost always involves the assumption that they are representing the proceedings of the Greeks or Romans, and not of the English: it is impossible therefore that such a school can be healthy, strong, or successful. It has not been enough con- sidered how much the draperies of different countries always must and will affect the style of sculpture suitable for them. In the north, with our thick woollen garments and warm clothing, no figure, either nude or clothed in muslin, can hope to appeal to the mind of the world at large, except as an unreal repre- sentation, which, as unreal, is wondered at and passed by without a thought of love or gratitude. And if I am told that the art of sculpture in the middle ages was unknown or rude in comparison with its state now, let me refer to some of the modern attempts at its imitation for a proof that this was not the case, as e. g. to the recumbent effigy of Archbishop Howley at Canterbury, or to another, of some more humble individual, in the south transept of Chichester Cathedral; a glance at which only, and a comparison with some of the noble medi\u00e6val effigies a comparison with some of the noble medi\u00e6val effigies lying in all the stateliness of their repose by their sides, will at once show any one that it is not merely                                       ",

The position is much, teenth and fourteenth centuries. The position is much, but not all, and requires very much more skill in its treatment than of late years we have had to bestow. From S. Clothilde we went first to the pleasant gardens of the Luxembourg\u2014gardens which always gardens of the Luxembourg\u2014gardens which always make one envious for London\u2014and thence to the recently recovered church of Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve. It has been arranged for service since I was in Paris last year, and is quite worth describing as an illustration of the way in which these things, sometimes at all events, are managed there. The choir has an altar raised under a baldachin, and there is another, though smaller, in the transept. The choir has stalls, and each angle of the dome is fitted up, one with a pulpit, the rest with seats. All these fittings are of the most trumpery kind; the stalls, pulpit, &amp;c., are mainly composed of canvas painted to imitate wood panelling, whilst the great altar itself is an entire sham, composed of paintings of curtains, marbles, and the like, which vie with each other in the attempt to deceive. To complete the picture, the church is lighted with common moderateur lamps; and one cannot help feeling that, as the Pantheon has been so economically converted into the church of S. Genevi\u00e8ve, so, with equal ease and at small sacrifice, might it again return to its Pagan name and use. One cannot but hope that this may not be, for the scheme for the establishment of clergy, and for their work in connection with this church, was conceived, as 1thought at the time, in a fine old missionary spirit. It is only fair to say that I have since heard that these fittings are said to be temporary, and that a sum has already been granted for the execution of more permanent substitutes. May they be more worthy of their purpose !                                      ",

If the effect of the inauguration of Louis Napoleon\u2019s the effect of the inauguration of Louis Napoleon\u2019s reign is not to be more longlived than the papering of Notre Dame, I shall enrol myself in the number of those who trust in a speedy change! In Notre Dame I always feel more pleasure in looking at the beautiful sculptures behind the stalls of the choir than in anything else. They are a most valuable series, treated in a bold and simple manner; and 1 am not a little glad that some casts of them grace the prodigious architectural collection which has been gathered with so much zeal and in- dustry to astonish the world at the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. From Notre Dame all the world goes of course to the Sainte Chapelle, and could we do otherwise than the Sainte Chapelle, and could we do otherwise than follow so good an example? The turret was just being placed upon the roof, and certainly looked over- lofty and attenuated, and, as far as 1 could judge through the scaffolding, of latish detail; when seen from the Tuileries it considerably overtops the towers of the cathedral. One never seems to see any progress inside the chapel; the same porters, above and below, always protest that they cannot admit any one without an order from some distant board of works, but neverthe- less always relent conveniently upon the slightest pros- pect of a fee, so that it is not a very difficult matter to The architectural museum in Cannon Row has also some casts from these magnificent works.

Altogether the group is one of uncommon variety and picturesqueness of out- line. Below, in the town, is a small church with a most happily-conceived though very simple bell-turret rising out of the roof, square in its plan, but capped with an octagonal spirelet.

At Schme- rikon, which we reached in four hours from Zurich, we left our steamer, and immediately embarked on a barge in order to go by the Linth canal to Wesen; but we found that, however expeditious this might be in descending, it was a kind of conveyance not to be recommended highly to any one wishing to ascend the canal, inasmuch as\u2014unlike ordinary canals this nothing more nor less than the glacier-tor- rent of the Linth bringing down the melting snow from the Gl\u00e4rnitsch and Todi glaciers, and rushing along at a really tremendous pace; to those, how- ever, who have time, it may be commended as afford- ing magnificent views of the mountains of Glarus and of those which rise so grandly above the Lake of and of those which rise so grandly above the Lake of Wallenstadt.

The canal, which at first looks more like a river, soon takes a bend to the S.W., and then, passing under a quaint wooden bridge, over which passes the road to Uznach, we found ourselves in what cer- tainly looked sufficiently canal-like. The stream is so rapid that the walls built up on either side are pre- served from being washed away by stone groins run- ning out into the stream, and acting as so many break- waters to keep the water in the centre; slowly and steadily our horses pulled us up, whilst we, mounted on the top of the cabin, were able to see over the walled sides of the canal, and to enjoy the glorious prospect before us. Before long our captain blandly informed us that he was going to stop for dinner at a way-side house, so we, anxious to make the same good use of our time, attempted to follow his example; unfortunately the landlord, though very jolly-looking, had a very badly stocked larder, and we had to satisfy ourselves with bread, honey, and wine; it is true, indeed, that our host did produce some cold meat\u2014portion, as I ima- gined, of a goat dressed some ten days back\u2014but this was not eatable, and was valuable only as furnishing was not eatable, and was valuable only as furnishing an opportunity to him of showing his perfect power of making the best of a bad thing; to season the goat he                                      ",

I fear the service was not one with much life in it\u2014if in such a thing one may venture to judge from a cursory glance at ex- ternals. Descending from the melancholy and squalid look- ing Catholic quarter, we soon came upon the Protes- tant church, dedicated in honour of S. Martin, which is somewhat remarkable. It is old, but it has been is somewhat remarkable. It is old, but it has been plastered, whitewashed, and then painted by some acute artist over its whole exterior in an extraordinary imitation of all kinds of inconsistent architectural devices ; pilasters, cornices, mouldings, tracery, and the like, are all boldly represented with black paint, and in such style that we all stopped the moment we saw it, struck by the conviction that it must be a scene from some play, so utterly absurd, flat, and out of all perspective did it look. The situation of Coire is very lovely, placed as it is just at the point where the Schalfiker Thal joins the valley of the Rhine, and upon the steep and rugged the valley of the Rhine, and upon the steep and rugged bottom slope of the mountains.

Let us learn from such examples as this at Bergamo that buildings do not always require a large open space in front of them in order to give them real dignity. The whole design of the Broletto is very simple. The ground on which it stands is divided by columns and piers, the spaces between them being all arched and groined. Towards the Piazza three of these arches, springing from rather wide piers, support the main building, and another supports an additional building to the west. Above the three main arches are three windows, of which that in the centre, though very much altered, still retains a partially old balcony in front, and bears proofs that it was the Ringhiera, in front, and bears proofs that it was the Ringhiera, from which the people standing in the Piazza were wont to be addressed by their magistrates. The win- dows on either side are very similar in their design and detail ; their tracery is of fair middle-pointed character; and the main points which strike one as being different from English work are the marble shafts with square capitals in place of mullions, a certain degree of square- ness and flatness in the mouldings, and the very pro- ness and flatness in the mouldings, and the very pro- nounced effect of the sills, which have a course of foliage and moulding, and below this of trefoiled arcaded ornament, which in one shape or another is to meet the traveller everywhere in Northern Italy; either, as the traveller everywhere in Northern Italy; either, as here, hanging on under the sills of windows, or else running up the sides of gables, forming string-courses and the like, but always unsatisfactory, because un-                                      ",

The detail of the arcades supporting the upper part of the building is throughout bold and simple, and I should say of the thirteenth century; the bases are quite northern in their section, the caps rather less deep in their cutting, but still in their idea, and in the grouping of tufts of drooping foliage regularly one above the other, reminding one much of French and German work, though certainly not so good as this generally is. There is a flatness about the carving, too, which gives one the impression of a struggle, in the hand of the carver, between the Classic and Gothic principles, in which the latter never quite asserted the mastery. The lesson to be learnt from such a building as this Broletto appears to me to be the excessive value of simplicity and regularity of parts carefully and construc- tionally treated ; for there are no breaks or buttresses in the design, and all its elements are most simple, yet nevertheless most beautiful. To the west of the Broletto is a good open staircase (much like that in the Piazza dei Signori at Verona), forming a portion of one side of the Piazza, and leading to the upper part of the buildings, and, 1 think, to the great clock-tower, which, gaunt and severe in its outline, undecorated and apparently uncared for, flings up its great height of rough stone wall boldly against the sky, and groups picturesquely with the irregular the sky, and groups picturesquely with the irregular buildings around it.

A chapel, erected as a sepulchral chapel by Barto- lomeo Colleone in the Renaissance style, on the north side of the nave, is most elaborately constructed of coloured marbles. The effect is too bizarre to be good, there is an entire absence of any true style in its design, and this makes it difficult to criticize it with much minuteness. But the best and most striking feature in the whole church is the north porch,! a most elaborate structure of red, grey, and white marble, to which a drawing with- out colour can hardly do justice. It is supported upon detached marble shafts, whose bases rest upon the backs of rather grand-looking lions, curiously grouped with children and cubs.

Our first visit in the morning was to the Piazza, in which stand the two cathedrals\u2014 the old and the new -side by side, and just beyond them the front of the Broletto, stretching its great length up a slight hill and along a narrow lane beyond the Piazza, whilst at its angle, towering up between it and the cathedrals, stands a tall and rugged stone campanile, without break or window until at the top, where, just as at Ber- gamo, great rudely-arched openings are left, through which appear the wheels and works of the bells. The new cathedral, approached by a flight of steps from the Piazza, has a great sham front. It has, moreover, a large dome, said to be inferior only in size to those of S. Peter\u2019s and the cathedral at Florence, but not prepossessing in its effect: nor did it seem to contain any pictures of much value. By a descent of some twenty steps from the south transept the old cathedral is reached. This of very early date, and constructed partly in stone and partly in brick. The most remarkable feature is the nave, which is circular in plan, with an aisle round it ; the central portion, divided by eight arches from the aisles, being carried up into a dome. The walls retain some fair medi\u00e6eval monuments, and beneath the church is a large crypt. The whole air of the Duomo Vecchio was chill and dismal to a degree, neglected and dirty, and apparently shut up except for occasional services, and it left no pleasant impressions on our minds of our first Lombard cathedral; and yet undoubtedly there is both here and at Aix-la-Chapelle\u2014where the plan of the cathedral is at Aix-la-Chapelle\u2014where the plan of the cathedral is                                      ",

The detail of much of the painting is cinquecento in its cha- racter, and not valuable as an example to be literally copied,' but its general effect is certainly very beau- tiful, and it is worthy of all praise in respect of the strictness with which it is kept subservient to the architecture, and in some respects, indeed, even serves to atone for its deficiencies, as e. g. in the broad painted to atone for its deficiencies, as e. g. in the broad painted horizontal borders, which take the place, very success- fully, of brick or stone string-courses, which in the construction are entirely omitted. It surprised me, 1 confess, very much to find a church painted throughout without any use of gold, and yet with good result ; yet so it is ; the effect is most solemn and religious, and very rich in colour, and I think there is absolutely no gold used; the fact is, that the white ground answers the purpose in a de- gree, though of course not to the full extent that gold would. But if the walls are beautiful in their colour, not less so is the pavement, which, from one end of the church to the other, remains to this day to all appear- This painting seems to have been followed to a considerable extent in the painting of the chapel at Merton College, Oxford.

Their effect is almost invariably beautiful in the extreme, and their one radical and condemning defect is, that they all re- quire to be held together by rods of iron connecting the capitals of the columns. This, however, is soon the capitals of the columns. This, however, is soon forgotten when one feels that there is no pretence ever or anywhere at its concealment. Notwithstand- ing this defect, one cannot help loving and admiring them; for there is a grace and beauty about the form and proportion of the Veronese trefoiled arch, such as is never seen, 1 think, elsewhere, and the very flatness of the carving and the absence of deep moulding seem of the carving and the absence of deep moulding seem all adopted in order that nothing may interfere with the simple beauty of the outline of the arch.

The pulpit was very large, and as the preacher delivered his sermon he walked from side to side, and often repeated again to those on his left the substance of what he had already said to those on his right.

In the first place, 1 must notice that the sculpture, which has the air of being rather sparingly used as too sacred the air of being rather sparingly used as too sacred a thing to be idly or profusely employed, is ex- a thing to be idly or profusely employed, is ex- ceedingly good.

The spandrels of the trefoils are filled-in with delicate sculpture, not pierced with the dark eye invariably found in the north. There is, too, an entire absence of mouldings, yet, notwithstanding this, the general effect is one of combined delicacy and richness of no common degree, so much does carefully-arranged and contrasted colour do for architecture. A third window is entirely of brick, save the trefoil head of the opening.

It was \u00e0 mere immense hall with a depressed roof, and no beauty of proportion or detail to make its immense spaciousness gratifying. From the Eremitani we found our way with some diffiulty through miserable streets to the church of S. Antonio, probably the most remarkable architectural work in many respects in this part of Italy. It seems that about A.p. 1231 it was determined to erect a great church in honour of S. Antony, the patron of Padua, and Niccolo Pisano, then one of the most eminent men of his day, was sent for to under- take the work. The view of the exterior given by Mr. Gally Knight will best serve to show to those who can refer to it in how singular and original \u00e0 manner he accomplished his work. S. Mark\u2019s at Venice must have been in his eye when he designed his church, and the crowd of cupolas which form its roof remind one forcibly of its most distinguishing feature. On first sight S. Antonio certainly does not pr\u00e9- possess the beholder in favour of such a bold departure from every-day rules of art. It is built almost entirely of a light-coloured brick, as much like the common London brick in colour as possible\u2014a most vile material wherewith to attempt the construction of a noble church.

Over and over again when at Venice must one go into S. Mark\u2019s, not to criticise but to admire; and if ever in any building in which the main object is the study of art, assuredly here it must also be to worship. Ithink I never saw an interior so thoroughly religious and religion-inspiring as this, and it is well, there- and religion-inspiring as this, and it is well, there- fore, not lightly to pass it by as useless for our general purposes. It seems to show, as strongly as any one example can, how much awe and grandeur even a small building may attain to by the lavish expenditure of art and precious materials throughout its fabric; for it is to this that S. Mark\u2019s owes its grandeur, and to it is to this that S. Mark\u2019s owes its grandeur, and to this only. There is nothing imposing either in its size or in its architecture: on the contrary, they appear to me to be both rather mean, and yet this grand display of mosaics upon a glorious gold ground makes the work appear to be both larger and better than it is. Could we but place one of our cold, bare places of worship by the side of S. Mark\u2019s, and let the development of Christian art in the construction of the fabric be ten times as great in our northern the fabric be ten times as great in our northern church as in the Venetian, we may yet rest assured that every religious mind would turn at once to the latter, and scarce deign to think of the former as a place for worship at all. If this so, does it not point most forcibly to the absolute necessity for the introduction of more colour in the interior of our buildings, either in their construction, or afterwards by the hand of the painter?

For these reasons then I defend them for the bare- ness and over-great plainness which is certainly at ness and over-great plainness which is certainly at first felt to be so remarkable in their work.

A very noticeable point in the general effect of the fa\u00e7ade of the Fondaco de\u2019 Turchi is that, from the peculiar shape and great projection of the capitals of the shafts and the narrow span of the arches, the whole of the arcading has, at a small distance, almost the effect of a series of trefoils, and so seems to pave the way for the continuous traceries of the Ducal the way for the continuous traceries of the Ducal Palace and other later buildings. One especial fault of the Venetians seems to have been their proneness to repeat the same architectural idea an infinite number of times; and there is some- thing in this so characteristic of the place and the people, that the reason for it is worthy of some con- sideration. Venice, surrounded by water, and cut off from that kind of emulation which in other places always has the effect of producing life and change very rapidly in the phases of art, seems to have contented herself, when once she had well done, with the conviction that improvement was either impos- the conviction that improvement was either impos- sible or unnecessary, and so, whilst changes were going on in the mainland, to have rested satisfied with a slight alteration only, and that one of detail always, for centuries ; and it is thus that I account for the singular sameness which characterized all the efforts of her Gothic artists.

And again, in the fronts of other and much smaller palaces\u2014indeed, in all the fronts of the Gothic period\u2014it is singular how exactly the same idea in the general arrangement is always preserved. Let me describe an ordinary palace. It is divided probably into three or four stories in height, the several stages generally separated by string-courses. The lower story opens, by an arched doorway in the centre, to the water; and on either side of this door- way a few small windows serve to light the basement. The second stage has a grand window of some five or six lights, divided by shafts of marble, and rich with tracery, in the centre; and on either side, one or two single lights, with tracery corresponding with\u2014and often, as it were, cut out in a slice from\u2014the traceries of the central windows. The third stage is nearly a re- production of the second, though perhaps slightly less important; and the upper stage is either again a repe- tition of the others, or else consists of a few small win- dows placed over the others, and very unimportant and unpretending. The whole is crowned by a slightly- projecting eaves-cornice, generally very meagre in its character, and with a line of genuine dog-tooth orna- ment on its lower edge.

Beyond these windows, one of late date, pro- bably inserted in the place of the original window, completes the similarity which the arrangement of the openings in this house bears to that common to all the later Gothic palaces.

It seems to be clear that we may take the year 1301 as that in which the earliest works now existing were commenced, and that again A.D. 1341 further works were undertaken, with the view of providing a grander council-chamber than had before existed, and that by about A.p. 1369 the structure was completed. These dates are very important, and, I believe, undisputed, the only question being as to which part of the building they refer to.

The lowest stage consists of a long and uniform arcade of very simple and noble pointed arches resting upon circular columns with elaborately carved caps. The intermediate stage is a magnificent arcade, sup- porting very glorious tracery, too well known to every- body to require much description, and divided from the stages above and below it by large and prononc\u00e9e lines of carved and moulded string-courses. It is important to observe that up to the top of the second string-course the whole of the architecture the second string-course the whole of the architecture is of the noblest type of Venetian pointed; the arches of the lowest stage are well proportioned, and, though very simply, still well moulded; and the detail of the whole of the second stage is, to say the least, not at all inferior.

This view is, so far as Iunderstand Mr. Ruskin's, ex- ceedingly different from his, which seems to make the entire sea front to be the work of the architect of A.D. 1341, whilst the erection of the Piazzetta front in imitation of the other is not mentioned at all in any of the old accounts, and the destruction of the work com- the old accounts, and the destruction of the work com- menced there in A.D. 1301 is equally unaccounted for. Moreover, there is no mark of diversity of style be\u00ac tween, the two fronts beyond some slight differences in the treatment of the sculpture; but it is quite im- possible to argue with any certainty from this, because it is plain that this difference might arise from the employment of two sculptors at the same time whose minds were as different in tone as their hands were in                                      ",

There is, it is true, but little to guide us, but still I think enough. In the first place, the shafts at the angles of the building, which in the earliest Venetian work were simple roundings off of the sharp angles, afterwards three-quarter shafts formed by rounding the angle and then sinking a line on each side a few the angle and then sinking a line on each side a few inches from it, became in time detached shafts pro- jecting from the face of the wall and apparently in- dependent of it, and held in their places by occasional bands bedded into the wall; in short, these later expedients were just as unreal, unnatural, and ugly expedients for marking the angle of the wall, as the others were lovely and simple modes of delicately softening its contour. The shafts at the angles of the upper stage of the Ducal Palace are of the late the upper stage of the Ducal Palace are of the late type, both ugly and weak, and, I am confident, never devised by the original architect of the finer work below. Besides this, the windows\u2014which are indeed arched are poor in their detail, which is small and entirely wanting in bold spirit: and where the tracery remains, as it still does in two windows at the extreme end of the sea front, it is of much later and poorer cha- of the sea front, it is of much later and poorer cha- racter than the traceries below.

Mark\u2019s end of the Piazzetta fa\u00e7ade. I only notice this, because, above the picturesque but debased work which he put up, there is a small portion of plain wall diapered with marble so as to correspond exactly with the upper stage of the palace, against which it is built, the upper stage of the palace, against which it is built, whilst the parapet and window over this gateway are also similar to those in the upper stage of the palace.

But I think that we have a curious confirmation of my view in another way ; for in the Bodleian Library there is a manuscript of the fourteenth century (the Romance of Alexander) which contains a most curious and remark- able view of Venice. It has been engraved at p. 26 of the second volume of the Domestic Architecture of the Middle Ages,' to which I must refer my readers; they will see that, with the usual amount of licence which characterizes most medi\u00e6val representations of places or towns, it has, nevertheless, been intended as an absolute representation of what its draughtsman had seen.

In the distance behind this drawing shows a picturesque assemblage of buildings, whilst figures are represented behind the upper arcade as though it were only a kind of immense balcony. There can be no doubt whatever that this old drawing tells most strongly in favour of my view that the upper stage was not built until after a considerable interval; for it is almost im- possible\u2014looking at the way in which the rest of the drawing is made\u2014to believe that all reference to it would have been omitted had it had any existence at the time. It will be seen that my supposition that the original design of the Ducal Palace was of considerably less elevation than the present building, would tend to make it very much more like the Byzantine type than it now is; but even now no one can dispute the family likeness. The amount of constructive art is as nearly as possible the same. The weight is supported by a suc- cession of shafts placed at very short intervals from each other, and in neither is there any approach to the sys- tem of pier, and arch, and buttress, so distinctive of pointed art in the North. The pointed arch is used, it is pointed art in the North. The pointed arch is used, it is true, in the palace; but, after all, the mere use of the pointed arch does not make thorough pointed archi- pointed arch does not make thorough pointed archi- tecture, and, therefore, all-glorious as it is as a variety of pointed architecture, the Ducal Palace is, 1 think, scarcely to be placed in the first class of pointed buildings.

The pointed arch is rarely used except in churches, and in its place traceries, increased in size and scale to do their work, are often made to carry the entire weight of walling above them, as is the case, to take the noblest example, in the second stage of the Ducal Palace. And it is remarkable that, when the arch was used, from a very early date it was the ogee arch, and not the arch formed by two simple curves : indeed it may almost be said that the pure pointed arch was never used, save where it would have been quite impossible with any other contrivance to bridge the necessary gap, or provide sufficiently for the weight to be supported.

Those in brick are even less satisfactory; but they occur mainly about the churches, and, as I do not recognise any- thing at all distinctively Venetian in their design or arrangement, it will be better to say more about them after we have seen the noble brickwork in other cities in the north of Italy, compared with which that Venice is not of the first order. In the practice of carving, as in that of moulding, I see no reason for yielding the palm to the Venetian. It is true, indeed, that the early capitals\u2014of which most magnificent examples exist at S.

They have some notable points of differ- ence from those to which we are used.

It is quite astonishing how very little this was ever used in England. Occasionally, indeed, it was freely used in grand buildings, and in some individual features\u2014as, e. g., in Eastern triplets\u2014it was frequently seen in thirteenth-century buildings; but, at the very period when, if ever, architecture was in its perfection, in the early part of the fourteenth in its perfection, in the early part of the fourteenth century, it was almost entirely forgotten and thrown aside. All honour, therefore, to the men who so per- severingly and determinedly used it as did the builders at Venice for three centuries! And all shame to us if we do not attempt for the future so far at any rate to follow in their steps! So rare any but shafted windows in Venice, that present 1 hardly remember a single instance of a window with monials formed a single instance of a window with monials formed by the continuous mouldings of the tracery ; and it is obvious that this gave occasion, not only to the use of beautiful marbles\u2014never so well used as in shafts- but also to the constant use of carved capitals. In domestic buildings, as I have before remarked, this arrangement of shafted windows is very valuable, because it suggests one obvious way in which we may unite traceried windows with the very newest arrangement of window-frames or sashes in the most comfortable nineteenth-century houses; for in these Venetian palaces the glass was always contained in a separate wooden frame within the marble shafts and tracery. This arrangement is not by any means unknown in Northern Europe, though certainly comparatively uncommon. There is an example of the thirteenth century at Easby Abbey, Yorkshire, whilst in France the won- derful collection of ancient houses at Cluny all have it, and at Ratisbon,                                      ",

And, again, they are used very beautifully for the support of open oinnacles, one at each angle, enclosing a figure, just as in the monuments of the Scaligers at Verona Examples of this are to be seen in the pinnacles which have been added between the gables of S. Mark's, which are exceedingly good in their effect: and again the pinnacles which terminate the church of the Madonna dell\u2019 Orto One more point is worthy of remark\u2014the treatment, namely, of the angles of buildings. These were almost always marked either by a roll-moulding or by a succession of nook shafts, sometimes extravagantly chevroned or otherwise ornamented. This, when done simply, was always satisfactory, but, in its later and more elaborate form, was, I think, as unsatisfactory. The delicate rounding off of the angles of walls was a point not unthought of in England. In the thir- a point not unthought of in England.

The twisted shafts of the upper stage of the Ducal Palace, and the triple and chevroned shafts of the Ca\u2019d\u2019Oro, are not im- provements upon the refinement of the earlier mode.

I was, perhaps, a little disappointed in not finding, as I had expected, the marble arranged generally in geometrical patterns; but this quite the exception ; and one sees only, in a medallion here and there, the exquisite beauty which their arrangement in this way may produce. As a rule the walls are faced with thin slabs of marble, each of the size in which it came to hand, sawn into as many slices as its substance would allow, and then riveted to the walls and held in place securely by projecting thin lines of stonework built into the wall, and cut with indented dentil ornaments along their edges. There is, however, a degree of weakness which is not at all satisfactory attendant upon this system of is not at all satisfactory attendant upon this system of incrustation, and I thought how much more noble such work might well become were it to be inlaid only where no strong work was required to be done, as e. g. in sprandrels of arches, or within arches, and not as in sprandrels of arches, or within arches, and not as here to the concealment of every one of the necessary constructional features.

Some of the great arches which stand in place of gables are divided into four or five square-headed lights by shafts supporting semicircular arches, the tympana of which are filled in with delicate and perpetually varied filigree-work in marble, whilst above them a succession of panels or medallions show all the resources of the noble mate- rials which were to be exhibited. In another arch, just over the entrance from the Piazzetta to the church, the tympanum of the arch is filled in with large medallions, one exquisitely carved, the others plain; whilst the arch of the window below the tym- panum has its beautiful marble spandrels gemmed on either side with medallions which, for exquisite on either side with medallions which, for exquisite arrangement of varicoloured marbles in geometrica patterns, are perfectly admirable.

The strongest impression, I believe, left on my mind, was one of wonder at the paltry character of the long array of what by courtesy are called, I suppose, wreaths of flowers, manufactured of pink gauze, or some equally unnatural material. These, with vulgar draperies hung outside the church doors, and in additional quantity about the altars, with the most noisy and gladsome ringing of bells, completed the external demonstra- tions ; all the shops were most studiously closed, and the churches and open places were thronged with people. At S. Mark\u2019s we heard some abominably light opera-music, which sounded, as may be imagined, very discordant within its solemn walls. We enjoyed the day, however, thoroughly; and in the evening, after dinner, got into our gondola and went to the Public Gardens, where I remember being very much amused by the absurd performances of three gentlemen on sorry hacks, who galloped up and down the only available piece of ground for horse-exercise in Venice, much to the edification of the bystanders, but, 1 fear, not so much to ours, as unfortunately their skill was but small.

This was altogether one of our hottest days, and took us fairly into a kind of district in which the heat is most oppressively felt.

The chief architectural feature of the city is the Ducal Palace, which contains, in the midst of a mass of Renaissance work of the poorest and most of a mass of Renaissance work of the poorest and most unsatisfactory kind, some remains of very noble pointed architecture. The finest portion is a long building of vast height, and retaining more or less of pointed work throughout, but especially remarkable for the exquisite character of the range of windows in its upper stage.

They consist of three lines of construction, the two inner formed of alter- nate voussoirs of brick and stone, carefully and regu- larly counterchanged, and the outer of a moulded terra-cotta ornament.

It is flanked by massive buttresses, and has two large and lofty trefoiled lancets, surmounted by a circular window of great size; the whole is very richly moulded and exe- cuted entirely in brick. The buttresses and roof finish at the top in a rude temporary-looking manner, and it is therefore impossible to solve the interesting question of their original terminations, which must I imagine have been pinnacles.

There are very large buttresses dividing each bay in this aisle, a feature which I saw here for the first time in Italy, and which, in addition to the design of the choir and transepts, would seem to show that this church was not entirely the work of an Italian.

The capitals vary very much in detail and in merit ; but one of the most successful is seen close to the west entrance, and recalls forcibly the best Northern pointed work, having, indeed, neither in detail nor in design, one single trace of an Italian in detail nor in design, one single trace of an Italian influence. So grand are the columns that the excessive poverty and lightness of the arches which divide the nave from the aisles, which is perhaps the one great defect of the church, is not for a long time noticed: they have, however, but little work to do, and so their lightness may perhaps be a virtue.

The cathedral, too, teaches little: its main office is, rather, to prove the consummate beauty and magnificence attainable by the pointed style carried out severely and simply on the very grandest scale. and this its interior does most triumphantly beyond all cavil. South of the cathedral there is a fine late brick campanile, which rises from behind some of the great public buildings in which the city abounds. A visit to Milan had always been looked forward to by me with great interest ; first, from curiosity as to the real effect and merits of the Duomo ; and secondly, from a longing to see the magnificent Sposalizio of Raffaele, a longing to see the magnificent Sposalizio of Raffaele, which forms the gem of the collection in the Brera; and this famous gallery was therefore one of the first objects of my curiosity.

The west front of the Duomo is a very fine example of Italian Gothic in marble; it is divided into five divisions in width, those in the centre and at the sides being the widest, and is constructed in yellow and dark grey marble in alternate courses, the former very deep, the latter generally shallow, but varying without much rule. All the roofs are flat, but finish at the west at different levels, and not in one continuous slope.

There is a large rose window in the centre division treated in a better manner than in the centre division treated in a better manner than is usual, and set within a square line of moulding, with small circles in the spandrels, and a line of square panels on each side; five other smaller windows are similarly treated.

It was the one great idea of the Renaissance builders, and, until they had taken out one of the old windows, and inserted in its place one of these hideous contrivances, they were never satisfied.

In general character this somewhat similar to the Broletto at Bergamo, but in real beauty it is scarcely inferior to any one building I have seen in Italy, Towards the Piazza it has four arches on the ground story, which is divided from the next stage by an arcaded string-course. This second stage has three windows only over the four arches below ; and another very noticeable irregularity is, that one of these windows, and that not the central, has a pedimental canopy above its arch, and has more shafts than the others. The central window has been modernized to some extent, but this was the Ringhiera, and the balcony still remains, though looking more modern than the rest of the front.

This not at all an uncommon feature in Italian pointed, and I have often wondered how it is that the eye is not at once disgusted with it, instead of being, as it usually is, pleased. I take it to be a justifiable device on some such ground as this: It takes much labour and skill to cut several shafts out of one block of marble, but all this labour and skill is unthought of, if they are entirely separated, or held together by a band which might perchance be made of some other material; this knot therefore is devised as the only means of explaining to us that the shafts so carved have really been accomplished with a very great expenditure of time and patience and a very great expenditure of time and patience and 1Ithink no apology is necessary for the omission of this modern stage in my view of the Broletto.

None of their houses are free from that general look of dreariness and lack of care which seems to afflict most Italian villas. Passing through Varese, we soon saw on our right a very famous pilgrimage church crowning the summit of a considerable hill, and approached by a succession a considerable hill, and approached by a succession of chapels, somewhat as in the still more famous pilgrimage church of Varallo, and so popular that round it there seems to have grown up a small town for the accommodation of the pilgrims. Farther on we passed the Lake of Varese, and from one point in the road had a view of no less than about five different lakes, one of which was Lago Maggiore. The Lago de Varese is a tame, uninteresting sheet of water, surrounded by low flat woody country, except at one point on the north, but even there the hills do not rise immediately from the lake. The only approach to old buildings that we saw were one or two brick campaniles of early date, and the remains of a castle, near Varese, finished at the top with the favourite forked battlement. We had much ado to make our driver understand our desire to reach Lago Maggiore without delay, and, to say the truth, there was something too much like cruelty in the attempt to compel our poor steeds to any such feat of speed and strength as the perform- ance of some six miles an hour really appeared to be.

In England there were no classic buildings to find here and there an admirer, or perhaps \u00e0 cluster of disciples, as in Italy; and men worked. therefore, freely, and in their own way, and apparently quite untrammelled with the suspicion even that there had ever been another style brought to perfection by people above all others civilised and refined in their habits and tastes, and distinguished by certain broad                                 ",

In England, therefore, in the middle ages, we may look in vain for any evidence of sympathy for a more ancient and venerable style than that which was then in the fulness of vigour and life; and consequently, if it be likely that any infusion of the art practised by the ancients could have aided the northern architects the ancients could have aided the northern architects in their work, we must not expect to find here any trace in their work, we must not expect to find here any trace of such assistance or such advantages. But in Italy the case was far different ; the love for the remains of earlier ages was never dead, but only slept, ever and anon to break forth in some new appropriation of ancient mate- rials, or some imitation and reproduction of an ancient form or idea. So in Venice, in the thirteenth century, whilst pointed arches were being reared by some to support the walls, not only of the churches but of the houses also, other hands were busy with the task of raising aloft those two classic shafts, with their antique capitals and detail, which, even to the present day, stand a peculiar and memorable mark of the Piazzetta of S. Mark, standing proofs, if such are indeed wanted, of S. Mark, standing proofs, if such are indeed wanted, that there had been artists in earlier days whose art was noble and well worthy of the emulation of men in all ages. And this classic seed fell into not ungrateful soil; for though there, as elsewhere throughout Europe, the value of the pointed arch as a feature in construction independently, that is, of its intrinsic beauty\u2014must have been well known, and was boldly recognised where it could not be avoided, there were nevertheless in a hundred ways proofs that men still remembered the a hundred ways proofs that men still remembered the lessons and traditions of the past, and used it with a certain degree of caution and unwillingness, and asso\u00ac                                     ",

This fact would seem, therefore, to place the Italian works of the middle ages in the ranks of the Italian works of the middle ages in the ranks of hybrid and mixed styles, and to debar them from com- petition with the more pure and contemporary works of northern Europe.

The essential elements of the two styles were their constructional features; Greek architecture was that of the lintel and impost, Gothic that of the arch. Each, in the finest examples, reached what we may now with safety call the very noblest elevation attainable by art; but mark how essentially the eleva- tion possible to the one was different from and hardly to be compared with that attainable by the other Greek architecture was the art of men in a state of nature, unskilled in science, but well skilled in lovely outlines, and possessed of a most delicate appreciation of form; rude, therefore, in their contrivances and con- struction, but delicate and refined in all their orna- mentation, its followers wasted labour incalculable in the placing together of great blocks of stone or marble the placing together of great blocks of stone or marble                                      ",

The natural result of this excess of science was, perhaps, that less delicacy and beauty of detail became necessary ; for when the plain rough walls, without carving and without ornament, were of necessity nevertheless so beautiful in their intricacy of outline and delicacy of structure, and when too so little (com- and delicacy of structure, and when too so little (com- paratively) plain surface remained to be looked at or dwelt upon, men cared less for the choicest examples of the sculptor\u2019s art, and were less obliged to satisfy the eye with them.

They endeavoured, honestly, so far as they could, to reconcile the principles of two styles which we are too prone to deem irreconcilable, and where they have achieved a real success let it be a lesson to us that the course which they pursued is still open, with larger opportunities and greater knowledge. At the same time they committed faults which we ought especially to beware of in any respect imitating. They ignored, as much as possible, the clear exhibi- tion of the pointed arch, and, even when they did use it, not unfrequently introduced it in such a way as to show their contempt for it as a feature of construc- tion; employing it often only for ornament, and never hesitating to construct it in so faulty a manner, that it required to be held together with iron rods from the very first day of its erection. This fault they often found it absolutely necessary to commit, because they scarcely ever brought themselves to allow the use of the buttress; and this reluctance was a remarkable proof their classic sympathies. Classic architecture was distinctly symbolic of rest as Gothic was of was distinctly symbolic of rest as Gothic was of life; the column and lintel of the one were as still and symbolical of perfect repose, as the arch of the other, sustained by the strong arm of the flying buttress, was of life, vigour, and motion. Italian architects then, in never resorting to the buttress, avowed their feeling that a state of perfect rest was the only allowable state for a perfect building, and they preferred almost always                                     ",

It is obvious that the pointed arch, descending upon the capital of a shaft without any visible stay or buttress to retain it in its place, would look weak and thin, and it was soon perceived that, in order to overcome this difficulty, the only course was to add to its substance by cusping it on the under side ; thence came the trefoiled arches so frequent in Italy, and always so very lovely. As so much depended upon them, no pains were spared in reducing their out- line into the very purest form. To this we owe the absolute perfection which characterises some of the trefoiled arches in early Italian work, those, for ex- ample (to take one instance among many), in the tombs of the Scaligers, at Verona, in which the mass of the trefoil descending from the arch conveys to the eye the impression of a firmness which, in part, certainly it gives, but which would nevertheless be insufficient in reality without the connecting rod of iron below. in reality without the connecting rod of iron below. In northern architecture arches invariably tell their own story and do their own work avowedly and with- own story and do their own work avowedly and with- out any disguise ; in Italy this the exception, not the rule, and the commonest exception is seen in the arcades dividing the aisles from the naves of churches, and in the large open arches forming the arcades upon which public and private buildings so often stand, though even these are sometimes (as in the second stage of the Ducal Palace at Venice) formed of con- tinuous traceries in place of arches, and dependent for their stability, like the single arches of tombs and monuments, upon the assistance of iron ties.

Examples of this are very frequent, and of the most capricious kind. At Cremona, e. g., the south transept has semicircular arches throughout, and the north transept pointed arches; the date of both being, however, as nearly as possible the same. At Verona, in the old house given in plate 11, some of the bearing arches are pointed, in plate 11, some of the bearing arches are pointed, some round; and again, in some buildings the main some round; and again, in some buildings the main arches are round, and the ornamental pointed.

It needs not, however, that examples should be multiplied, for almost every building exhibits some trace of this kind of confusion of idea. of confusion of idea.

So strong was the love for the shaft, that moulded columns (though they occur in the cathedral of Verona and at Milan) are scarcely ever met with; simple columns are used everywhere\u2014in the arcades, in the streets, and elsewhere\u2014in place the arcades, in the streets, and elsewhere\u2014in place of any other form of shaft. The proof, however, of the love for it is strongest when they are seen in- troduced everywhere in place of monials, supporting window traceries and smaller arches. In this way they are frequently used in the greatest profusion, and in- variably with the greatest beauty of effect, but perhaps are never so beautiful as when placed one behind the other (as they very commonly are), so that in eleva- tion they appear delicate and fragile, but when seen in perspective exhibit ample strength and substance for their work. These shafts not unfrequently decrease in size as they approach the capital, and often with very beau- tiful effect, herein differing from the unvarying custom of the shafts in Northern architecture, and imitating, no doubt, the shape of those which, as at S.

The great aim of Italian architects above all others was, I believe, to obtain what is commonly called breadth of effect; and this, when successfully accom- plished, is an achievement of so great value that they who succeed in it can never be artists of mean powers; it is, too, the very point in which northern architects it is, too, the very point in which northern architects were most careless to succeed, and about which they apparently thought least, perhaps in part because the gloomy skies so usual here allowed the deep recessed windows, hiding their beauties between the far project- ing buttresses, which only just leave them space to show                                      ",

There is one point in which a curious practical dif- ference exists between our old work and most old Italian. Here it was not the custom to have key- stones to pointed arches, whilst there it is quite the rule to have them; this may have been partly, per- haps, because it was a matter of convenience to mark the central stone in arches composed of alternate voussoirs of brick and stone, and partly some relic of classic traditions ; not only, however, is there a key- stone, but sometimes, as in the Broletto at Brescia, this additionally distinguished, above the rest of the stone voussoirs, by some small ornament carved upon it. With one more fact 1 think 1 may end what I have to say on this head; this with refer- ence to the mode in which some of the Italian brick arches very beautifully follow the fashion, not so uncommon in stone, of increasing in depth as they T 2                                          ",

The effect is always very good, and, though quite unknown to our forefathers in England, may well be introduced in our works, in England, may well be introduced in our works, as it gives great appearance of strength, and is, no doubt, at the same time, the strongest possible form of arch.

It will have been I ought not to forget to notice. It will have been seen from the drawings I have given how singularly deep, and generally alike, the brick cornices are which crown the walls of all brick churches; these are not only used in their proper sphere, but carried up all the gables, breaking round buttresses, and doing about as much as they well can towards the destruction of the effect of all the fronts which they surmount. I know only one example of this kind in the North, and this, as I have already said, is in the north transept of the cathedral at L\u00fcbeck, and is so Italian in its look, that one cannot help suspecting its origin. Not the least, perhaps, of the sins of these cornices is, that in nine cases out of ten, when they are used in gables, the gables are sham fronts; sham are used in gables, the gables are sham fronts; sham fronts seeming, both in Italy and Germany, to have been most popular wherever brick was most used. I trust that enough has now been said to show useful the study of Italian brickwork must be how useful the study of Italian brickwork must be to those who are compelled, as we so often are, to use the same material in buildings for whose good                                      ",

But, far as it is in advance of any other ancient brick- work, there are points in which we must refuse to follow it ; we need not, for instance, in attempting to rival its beauties, confound them with faults which were essentially those of the whole Italian style, and not specially of the brickwork. We may with the greatest advantage emulate the Italian system of brick window tracery, whilst we take care never to imitate the equally common custom in Italy of erecting sham fronts in order to display our traceries. Again, though they never used any but red bricks, there is no reason why we should not enliven our work with the contrast of other colours ; Germany gives us examples of green of other colours ; Germany gives us examples of green and black bricks, and, indeed, Italy affords one and black bricks, and, indeed, Italy affords one (S. Antonio, in Padua) of a yellowish brick; and, no doubt, the effects producible by these contrasts of colour are just such as Italian architects would have been the very first to avail themselves of, had they had the opportunity. This their particoloured works in marble sufficiently prove. As to the question whether it be desirable or not to introduce brick at all in ecclesiastical edifices, or generally in public buildings, one might, a few I years ago, have been anxious to say somewhat. trust, however, that the ignorant prejudice which made many good people regard stone as a sort of sacred material, and red brick as one fit only for the commonest and meanest purposes, is fast wearing out, and that what now mainly remains to be done is to show it may most effectively be used, not only in external, but also in internal works.

At the present day there is, 1 think, absolutely no one point in which we fail so much, and about which the world in general has so little feeling, as that of colour. Our buildings are, in nine cases out of ten, cold, colourless, insipid, academical studies, and our people have no conception of the necessity of obtaining rich colour, and no sufficient love for it when success- fully obtained. The task, therefore, and duty of architects at the present day is mainly that of awakening and then satisfying this feeling; and one of the best and most ready vehicles for doing this exists, no doubt, in the rich-coloured brick so easily manufactured in this country, which, if properly used, may become so effective and admirable a material. The other mode of introducing colour in construction, by means of the use of marbles, deserves also some notice. In my notes upon the buildings as they were passed on my journey, 1 have described two modes in which this kind of work was treated ; the first was that practised in Venice, the veneering of brick walls with thin layers or coats of marble; the other, that practised at Bergamo, Cremona, and Como, in which the marble formed portion of the substance of the wall.

It might almost be said that one mode was devised with a view to the concealment, and the other with a view to the explanation, of the real mode of construction. I have already described, at some length, the main features of these old works in marble, and 1 feel, therefore, that all that need now be done is to point out the degree to which they afford matter for our imitation with the coloured materials and marbles which we fortunately have in Great Britain fit for the purpose, though not in very great variety. There certainly appears to me to be a certain extent to which we may safely go in the way of inlaying or incrustation : we may, for instance, so construct our buildings as that there may be portions of the face of their walls in which no strain will be felt, and in which this absence of strain will be at once apparent; obviously, to instance a particular place, the spaces enclosed within circles constructed in the spandrels of a line of arches can have no strain of any kind. They a line of arches can have no strain of any kind. They are portions of wall without any active function, and may safely be filled in with materials the only object of which is to be ornamental.

In Venice we have some grand examples, at S. Mark\u2019s. of this system of incrustation filling in the whole of the space within large arches: here it is lawful, be- cause there is no weight upon it to thrust it out of its place or disjoint it, as the least pressure most cer- tainly always will. So far in praise of the Venetian system. But in other parts of the same building we have this system carried to a length which I cannot but think most mistaken, and which, I most heartily trust, may never find imitators here. In these they constructed their arches in brick, and then entirely covered them with marble. Of course there was some difficulty in doing this, and the way in which the difficulty was met was sufficiently ingenious : a suc- cession of thin slabs of marble were placed round the soffit of the arch, having perhaps enough of the coh\u00e9- sion given by the form of the arch to enable them to support their own weight, and further supported by support their own weight, and further supported by metal staples let into the joints of the brickwork, The edges of these thin slabs projected sufficiently in advance of the face of the brickwork to allow of their being worked with some kind of pattern\u2014gene- rally, as has before been said, a sort of dentil\u2014and giving some support to the thin slices of marble with which the walls were then covered. The whole system was excessively weak; and this can nowhere be better seen than in the Fondaco de Turchi, where almost the whole of the marble facing and beautiful medal- the whole of the marble facing and beautiful medal- lions, in which it was once so rich, have peeled off. and left nothing but the plain and melancholy sub- and left nothing but the plain and melancholy sub- stratum of brick.

It would be unjust not to say that often, very often, this system of incrustation, even when carried to the extreme limits of what seems to be lawful, wins upon our love by the exquisite delicacy and taste of the sculptured patterns, worked in low-relief, with which it is covered.

The surfaces of the walls in Venetian work were either entirely inlaid, or else inlaid within a square enclosing border of projecting moulding. The inlay- ing was composed of a number of rectangular slabs of marble, not by any means always of the same of marble, not by any means always of the same size, supported to some extent by the projections of the enclosing marbles or by those of the archivolt, but the enclosing marbles or by those of the archivolt, but always dependent mainly on metal cramps let into the fabric of the wall; and, when possible, these marbles                                      ",

The other mode of introducing constructional colour in marble commends itself to one\u2019s reason as that which is most likely to endure for ages, and as that, therefore, which ought, wherever it may be, to be adopted. The first idea of the architects of these build- ings seems to have been to arrange their material with as much regard to strong contrasts of colour as was possible. The first thing they did, therefore, was to alternate the colours of every course of masonry, either simply as in the Broletto at Como and in Sta. Maria Maggiore at Bergamo,\u2019 or as in the west front of the cathedral at Cremona, where very narrow layers of white marble are laid between each of the other courses. which are of course so much the more defined. The description which I have already given of these works, as well as of the porch at Bergamo, will show regular is the way in which this system of counterchanging the colours was carried out by the purely constructional school ; this is, in fact, the great mark of difference between the constructional and the encrusting school of Italian architects, the whole arrangement of coloured materials by the two schools being quite different, and producing singularly different results. The most common faults of the Venetian system of incrustation must have been that upon a general surface of plain wall you had here and there a square patch of marble surrounding a window opening; that of the other system would be, in the opinion of many, that you have too stripy an effect of See plate 34, p. 232. 2 See plate 1, frontispiece. 2 See plate 1, frontispiece.

Besides this, if ever the day shall come when our buildings thus do their duty and teach their proper lesson to the eye, we may hope that we shall see a feeling, more general and more natural, for colour of all kinds and for art of every variety in the bulk of our people. At present it is really saddening to converse with the majority of educated men on any question of colour; for them it has no charms and no delight. The puritanical uniformity of our coats, indeed of all our garments, is but a reflection from the prevailing lack of love of art or colour of any kind.

Is all this really so, or is it not rather true that the vocation of artists of every kind is, as it always was, to lead and not to follow the stream, to show by their lives and their works that there may still be something of the sublime and the noble about man\u2019s works even in the midst of effeminate luxury, and that art, even after the deadliest and longest sleep, and that art, even after the deadliest and longest sleep, can once more buckle on her armour, and, full of the generous spirit of the men of old, breast all difficulties and surmount all opposition with the one thought and one object of doing all that she does in faith, with a strong heart and earnest purpose, truth always before her eyes, and manifest in all she does? It is truth only, in every line and every detail, which can ever make great architecture,\u2014truth only which one would wish to extract from the works of our forefathers, \u2014and truth only which I have desired to discover in the works of those Italian artists whose labours I have been considering, and whose efforts 1 have endeavoured to set before my readers; and it is this desire to elucidate the truth from these works of theirs, and to apply it for the benefit of art, which can alone be my excuse for having undertaken the work which I have now brought to a conclusion.
