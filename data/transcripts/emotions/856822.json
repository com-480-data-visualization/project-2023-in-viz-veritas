In the earlier periods of the republic, San Lorenzo was considered the Metropolitan Church of Florence. Its existence is traced as far back as the year 3g5, when it was consecrated by St Ambrose; at the distance of nearly three hundred years, on its receiving some repairs and embellishments, this ceremony was again performed by Pope Nicholas the Second in person.

The whole structure is considered as fine, an opinion sanctioned by Michael Angelo himself; but according to my idea, its general aspect possesses none of that beauty arising from just proportions , so essential to simplicity and grandeur in architecture. It measures nearly 400 feet in length, and only 100 in width, (not including the chapels,) the body of the church is therefore ungracefully long, while the cross is pro\u00ac is therefore ungracefully long, while the cross is pro\u00ac portionably too short. These defects are rendered more conspicuous by the unusual height of the pillars that divide the parts of the church, and which greatly contribute to make the intermediate spaces appear still more narrow. The church itself may be said to possess few claims to admiration; but its chapels are highly interesting. One of these was planned by Cosmo, first Grand Duke of Florence, after a design of Varari\u2019s being intended as \u00e0 Mausoleum for the Medicean family.

The light, dimly penetrating through high narrow windows of painted glass, strikes obliquely against tho walls and pillars, leaving a long and dark void below, gloomy and dim, but yet not unpropitious to the grandeur of general effect.

ON viewing the works of ancient art, we are naturally led to inquire into the causes which produced such early and almost unrivalled excellence in statuary and sculpture. The answer is to be found in the manners of the Greeks, which peculiarly encouraged the progress of talent in these pursuits, and offered the finest op- of talent in these pursuits, and offered the finest op- portunities for study. Every ceremony of their poetic religion\u2014the rites observed at their marriages and public festivals\u2014their funeral processions and publie games, were so many occasions for rousing talent, and presenting to the artist the finest models for his imitation and study. This was peculiarly the case with regard to sculpture. In the Olympic games, and other exhibitions of the same kind, where tlie highest honours were bestowed upon personal prowess, the artist had the best oppor- tunity of studying the perfection of the human figure. Ile saw, in these displays of agility and strength, the noblest forms in all the animation of contest, and roused to the greatest exertion by that hope of distinction, which the rewards bestowed on the successful compe\u00ac titor, were so well calculated to produce.

The effect that this must have had in exciting animation and talent is evident. The nature of their mythology was equally important. In our religion the subjects are grand, noble, and impressive; but almost too sacred for the pencil or chisel. The mythology of the Greeks was, on the con- trary, gay and animating. Even while seeking to re- present the splendour of the Deity, grand severe in dignity, the ancients have surpassed us. There is no comparison between the Almighty, by Raphael, and the Jupiter of Phidias, as described by ancient writers.* The artist, whether in statuary or painting, owes his happiest efforts to imagination, to which imitation and recollection alone contribute. When Rembrandt paints a Sorcerer enchanting a Sea God, he paints a being as purely ideal as the Heavenly Father, by Michael Angelo. When Salvator Rosa paints Banditi in a Cave, he in part only copies from what he may have seen; all the horror and effect is produced by the efforts of imagination. Thus, in every subject there is poetry. Composition may be styled the sentiment\u2014the pencil and chisel the language, of the sentiment\u2014the pencil and chisel the language, of painting and sculpture.

Various instruments of surgery have been found among the innumerable objects discovered in different excavations, as well as in those of Pompeii and Herculanum, but no specimens nor traces of anatomy.

At the Olympic games statues were made of those who had been often victors, when the exact size, the peculiar fornis, all the beauties, and even the very the peculiar fornis, all the beauties, and even the very defects of their bodies, were carefully preserved, that they might serve as models of manly strength, of swift- ness, and prowess.

The small city styled Parthenope, formed the eastern portion of Naples, while on the west side of the gulf, existed another small city founded by the Cumeans, by whom it was denominated Neapolis, or new city, after\u00ac wards colonised by the Romans, who built the central part between these two, by which they were ultimately united, forming one great Capital which retained the Greek name Neapolis. But if the city be not rich in ancient edifices, in temples or crumbling pillars, it possesses a morceau of antiquity of gr\u00e9at interest. This people proud of their grecian extraction which they trace from the destruction of Troy, and ambitious of preserving a memorial of their origin, caused a model of the celebrated Trojan horse to be cast in bronze, which they regarded with a sort of reverential awe, assuming it in their badge, and in their arms. This colossal statue stood in the square of San Gennajo a venerated relic to which they attributed many virtues, more especially the power of curing maladies in horses, by invigorating and renewing their strength.
