The Gen\u00e9vese were early in the field, and to their exertions is the Protestant Church materially indebted for the rapid progress of its tenets, and for the foundation which it at present stands. The circumstance which led the great apostle of the Reformation, Calvin, to adopt Geneva as his residence is singular. Passing through that town, on his route is singular. Passing through that town, on his route from France to Germany, he encountered his friend Farel, then resident at Geneva, who entreated him to remain there and to assist him in his ministry. Calvin, however, was desirous of proceeding, till Farel, spiritu quodam heroico afflatus (says Beza) threatened him, in the most solemn manner, with the curse of God if he the most solemn manner, with the curse of God if he did not stay to assist him in that part of the Lord's vine\u00ac yard. Calvin accordingly complied, and was appointed professor of Divinity. It was at Geneva that the singu\u00ac lar interview took place between Calvin and Eckius re- lated to Lord Orrery by Deodati. * Eckius being sent by the pope legate into France, upon his return resolved to take Geneva in his way, on purpose to see Calvin, and, if occasion were, to attempt reducing him te the Romish church.

Setting up his horses at an inn, he inquired where Calvin lived, which house being shown him, he knocked at the door, and Calvin himself came to open it to him. Eckius inquired for Mr. Calvin; he was told he was the person. Eckius acquainted him he was told he was the person. Eckius acquainted him that he was a stranger, and having heard much of his fame was come to wait upon him. Calvin invited him to come in, and he entered the house with him, where, discoursing of many things concerning religion, Eckius perceived Calvin to be an ingenious, learned man, and desired to know if he had not a garden to walk in ; to which Calvin replying he had, they both went into it, and then Eckius began to inquire of him why he left the Romish church, and offered him some arguments to per\u00ac suade him to return ; but Calvin could by no means be persuaded to think of it. At last, Eckius told him that he would put his life into his hands, and then said he was Eckius, the pope\u2019s legate. At this discovery Calvin was not a little surprised, and begged his pardon that he had not treated him with the respect due to his quality, Eckius returned the compliment; and told him if he would come back to the church he would certainly pro\u00ac would come back to the church he would certainly pro\u00ac cure for him a cardinal\u2019s cap; but Calvin was not to be moved by such an offer.

But Calvin, giving him thanks, assured him that he was well satisfied with his condition. About this time dinner was ready, when he entertained his guest as well as he could, excused the defects of it, and paid him every respect. Eckius after dinner desired to know if he might not be admitted to see the church, which anciently was the cathedral of that city. Calvin very readily answered that he might ; accordingly, he sent to the officers to be ready with the keys, and de\u00ac sired some of the syndics to be there present, not ac\u00ac quainting them who the stranger was. As soon, therefore, as it was convenient, they both went towards the church; as it was convenient, they both went towards the church; and as Eckius was coming out of Calvin\u2019s house he drew out a purse, with about one hundred pistoles, and pre\u00ac out a purse, with about one hundred pistoles, and pre\u00ac sented it to Calvin; Calvin desired to be excused; Eckius told him he gave it to buy books, as well as to express his respects for him.

Thereupon they went into the church; and Eckius, having seen all, told Calvin he did not expect to find things in so decent an order, having been told to the contrary. After having taken a full view of every thing, Eckius was returning out of the church, but Calvin stopped him a little,-and, calling the syndics and officers together, took out the purse of gold which Eckius had given him, telling them that he had received that gold from this worthy stranger, and that now he gave it to the                                 ",

The syndics thanked the stranger; and Eckius admired the charity and modesty of Calvin. When they were come out of the church, Calvin invited Eckius again to his house; but he replied that he must depart ; so, thanking him for all his civilities, offered to take his leave: but Calvin waited on him to his inn, and walked with him a mile out of the territories of Geneva, where with great compliments they took a farewell of each other.\" The last moments of Calvin were remarked as the finest of his life. Like a parent who is about to leave a beloved family, he bade farewell to those whom he had watched over so long with a truly parental care.

There are many cascades of greater pretensions, having a larger body of water, or a higher fall, but none can be more truly beautiful.

The accumulation of waters, which caused the inundation, was not known for a considerable time, until some of the inhabitants of the valley remarked the unusual appearance of the stream, which continued trickling along without augmentation, although the snows had begun to melt. Several people went to the source to ascertain the cause, and found, to their dismay, that a vast quantity of ice, having accumulated from the glacier of Getroz, had fallen across the upper part of the valley, and formed a vast lake, into which the Dranse flowed, secured from outlet by the artificial embankment. Anxiety and alarm spread throughout the country, and active measures were adopted to guard against the danger already appre- hended to be at hand. It was proposed to cut a gallery through the immense wall of ice, and drain the lake gradually. The plan was adopted, and with great labour and difficulty it was eventually accomplished.

As we proceeded the gloom became positive darkness, and, I must confess, I did not feel at all com\u00ac fortable in my situation; but, as I looked forward, I saw the dull twinkling of a solitary light, which seemed to proceed from the extremity of our unpleasant and even dangerous pathway. The guide informed me the light was placed here by the hermit, as a direction to his lonely retreat ; for some accidents had occurred to the poor who had ventured thither without a guide. The passage now became excessively steep, and reemed as though it had been cut into the rude resem\u00ac blance of a staircase. When, with great fatigue, we had nearly reached the summit, a most extraordinary cry was heard, which, reverberating amongst the recesses of this wilderness, conveyed a strange feeling of awe, amount- ing almost to terror.

A few thousand francs worth of coins issued by Maria Luigia, Duchess of Parma, Napoleon\u2019s widow (which may perhaps be said to excel even the coins of the Italian kingdom), were struck at Milan. Milan was a city of great importance in the time of the Romans, particularly towards the latter end of the empire, when it was even the seat of some of the em\u00ac perors before the invasion of the barbarians.. It was destroyed by Attila so completely that its archbishop, St. Ambrose, emphatically copying one of Cicero\u2019s ex\u00ac pressions, said of it, and of some other cities destroyed by that conqueror, that they were \u201c tot semirutarum urbium cadavera. It was, however, rebuilt, and, in the twelfth century, it was, as it still is, the most flourishing and powerful of all the cities of Lombardy. The emperor, Frederic I. (Barbarossa), found in the Milanese a people determined to resist his tyrannical pretensions, and his German legions would have in vain attempted to reduce that city to a slavish obedience, had not many of the other cities of Lombardy joined the emperor against their own countrymen. Frederic, assisted by Pavia, Cremona, Lodi, and other neighbouring cities, in addition to his own Germans, besieged Milan, and in seven months suc\u00ac ceeded in taking it, the citizens being reduced to the last extremities, and the emperor insisting on their uncon\u00ac ditional surrender.

Some writers have supposed that one of the villas which Pliny possessed, in the neighbourhood of Como, occupied this site; but, though he had many in the vicinity of the lake, he vet describes only his two favourite retreats, and the situation of the Pliniana corresponds with neither.

The Rialto is situated nearly in the middle of the canal, and is formed of one arch, about eighty-one feet wide A double row of mean shops, twenty-four in number on each side, are built upon the bridge, which is so coated with dirt as scarcely to permit the marble of which it is constructed to be visible. The canals of Venice have left very few open spaces in the city, and the Broglio, or portico under the ducal palace, the Piazza of St. Mark, and the Rialto, are therefore the places in which the Venetians are accustomed to meet and converse. It is difficult to conjecture why Otway chose the Rialto for his conspirators to meet at ; no place could be less proper for secret deliberation.

It was built in the time of the doge Domi\u00ac nico Morosini, who was elected in the year 1148. The architect, Buono, was much celebrated for the buildings which he designed in Naples, in Pistoia, in Florence, and in Arezzo. The summit of the Tower of St. Mark is consecrated to science.

The rules and orders of the tribunal were all written in the hand of one of the three inquisitors, and deposited in a box, of which each was in turn to possess the key. All the forms of proceeding were to be kept inviolably secret. none of the inquisitors bearing any external sign of their office. The warrants commanding the appearance of parties before them never issued in their own names, but in that of the Secretary of the Tribunal. If the order was disobeyed, the Messer grande, or head of the police, was directed to seize the refractory party, not at his house, but suddenly in some retired place, and conduct him to the state prison. Spies were selected from every rank of people, the nobility, the citizens, and the priests, to whom rewards of every kind were promised. Four spies, unknown to one another, were attached to each of the foreign ambassadors, and, if these men were unable to penetrate the secrets of the stranger, a banished Venetian was directed to take refuge in his house, and to betray the party who protected him.

I turned to Alessandro, and spoke to him thus : * Let us return home with the utmost speed, since it is impossible for us here to make any stand ; behold, the enemy scales the walls, and our countrymen fly before them, overpowered by numbers. Alessandro, much alarmed, answered, Would to God we had never come hither;' and, so saying, he turned with the utmost precipitation, in order to depart. I thereupon the utmost precipitation, in order to depart. I thereupon reproved him, saying, Since you have brought me reproved him, saying,  Since you have brought me hither, I am determined to perform some manly action, and levelling my arquebuse, where I saw the thickest crowd of the enemy, I discharged it with a deliberate aim at a person who seemed to be lifted above the rest. but the mist prevented me from distinguishing whether he was on horseback or on foot.

Afterspeak- ing of the Arch of Septimius Severus, Mr. Forsyth adds, \u201cConstantine\u2019s Arch is larger, nobler, and even more correct in its architecture ; the only object now in re\u00ac view; but is that architecture its own? We know that its columns, statues, and relievi are not ; and we may fairly suspect that even its composition was also stolen from other works, as Constantine\u2019s reign was notorious for architectural robbing.'
