His cast of countenance was very well known in the latter days of Rome, for the younger Gordian was reckoned to be a strong likeness of him. In the Pallavicini gallery there is a black Scipio with two scars on his skull. The Galba has too much hair on his head, unless, like some modern monarchs, that emperor chose to be repre- sented full curled when he was notoriously bald.

This eliminates Vespasian and his son, but the Abate is obliged to suppose that the S. P. Q. R. were prefixed by the half republican authorities after the invasion of Totila. If that was so, the senate and the Roman people of that unhappy period must have thought it immaterial, whether or not an inscription admitted of a sensible or even a gram- matical construction. It has been remarked that the architrave and frieze of these columns have been blended together so as to form an uniform surface for the insertion of the inscription. The same peculiarity is observable on the Portico of Octavia, in the Pescaria, which was restored by the above mentioned Emperors. Severus has left more records of his architectural exploits than any other master of the Roman world. The Pantheon, the Portico of Octavia, the two arches which bear his name, and the inscription now under the two arches which bear his name, and the inscription now under discussion, are all proofs of his attachment to the arts and to the imperial city; but in order to make him worthy of the praise bestowed upon him by Spartianus, it is necessary to adopt an alteration                                       ",

A similar substitution is observable in the inscription the Janus in the Vela- brum, and also in that of the bronze tablet in the Capito- line Museum. Caracalla could not bear to be reminded of his deceased brother. He wept whenever he saw the image or statue, or was any way reminded of Geta.

The Abate Fea could see neither Comitium nor Gr\u00e6costasis, either single or united, in these co- lumns, which, says he, assuredly belong to the Temple of Castor and-Pollux.* The Chevalier Bunsen+ gave them the name of a Temple of Minerva, having pre- viously assigned them to Castor. The excavations of the Abate have shown that this edifice did not stand. as was formerly believed, upon the declivity of the as was formerly believed, upon the declivity of the Palatine; but that it rose from a magnificent base * Fea, Descriz. di Roma, vol. ii. p. 274. + Les Forum de Rome, 1837.

I found in 1828 that a great deal had been done to clear those cor- ridors which were the most incumbered with ruins; and that those parts which threatened danger had been propt up by substantial brick walls, a sort of new entrance had been constructed on the side fronting the Temple of Venus and Rome, and a very judicious finishing of brickwork had given strength to the ruin that quarter. The hall allotted to the Imperial Family had been re- stored as far as was practicable, and the Imperial Podium had also been partially restored. A discovery had been made of the sub- been partially restored. A discovery had been made of the sub- terranean passage by which the Emperors proceeded from the Palatine to the amphitheatre. This passage was constructed by Commodus, and was nearly fatal to him, for here was concealed the assassin who missed his aim for the sake of the sarcasm that accompanied his blow. A garden with some agreeable walks had been planted on the declivity of the Celian Hill, immediately contiguous to the amphitheatre, and every care had been taken to protect the whole monument from future injury. The controversy respecting the original level of the Arena has not, I believe, been yet decided; and as the underground stone-work which gave rise to it has been again covered with the soil, it is not likely that fresh arguments will be found to assist either of the con- tending parties. The question, it is modestly confessed,\u201c has occa\u00ac sioned more clamour than has redounded to the honour of antiquarian researches; but the labours of BIANCHI could not be considered use less had they done no more than disinter the inscriptions given in a preceding page. It may be remarked, in regard to the second a preceding page. It may be remarked, in regard to the second of these inscriptions, that if the stone-work discovered by Bianchi under the actual level, was raised by Basilius in order to prop ur the arena, there is no necessity for the supposition that the ancient the arena, there is no necessity for the supposition that the ancient level was, as some contend, fifteen feet lower than it now appears to be.

The nine Muses could hardly have stood in six niches; and Juvenal certainly does not allude to any individual cave.* Nothing can be collected from the satirist but that somewhere near the Porta Capena was a spot in which it was supposed Numa held nightly consultations with his nymph, and where there was a grove and a sacred fountain, and fanes once consecrated to the Muses; and that from this spot there was a descent into the valley of Egeria, where were several artificial caves. It is clear that the statues of the Muses made no part of the deco- ration which the satirist thought misplaced in these caves; for he expressly assigns other fanes (delubra) to these divinities above the valley, and moreover tells us that they had been ejected to make room for the Jews.

On the 28th of the same month, one Signor Tomasetti, breaking up a continued mass of peperine which covers the declivity of the hill near the road to Marino, on the ground called Montecucco, when he came to the distance of 571 Roman canes from the spot where Signor Carnevali had discovered his vases, suddenly found several cinerary vases, all of them broken excepting one. These were under the layer of peperine. * Here you have Pompey\u2019s villa, Pompey\u2019s tomb, or, if that will not satisfy curiosity, the tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii; and, in another quarter, the tomb of Ascanius.

Visconti has gained nothing by showing the remote antiquity of similar manufactures. No one doubted that fact, but the question evidently reduces itself to the assigning these individual inter- ments to a time and nation to which they may be rea- sonably referred. The inquiry undoubtedly is, sup- posing the whole discovery to be established, and that nothing has been interpolated, what people ever lived on the Alban hill at any period who might have made these the Alban hill at any period who might have made these vases? After my return to England in 1818 I was favoured by an English antiquary* with a suggestion which is certainly more ingenious, and it may be thought more satisfactory, than the researches of Visconti. That which puzzled the Italian most has furnished the English- man with the clue of his conjecture; for those figures which Visconti thinks may be letters, or, perhaps, whole words, like the Chinese characters, have induced him to come to a very different conclusion.

It is certain that the mythology of the Asi, although its doc- trines may have been clad in another guise, was not confined to the Scandinavian race. And it seems that a character bearing a close affinity to the Runic alphabet was once widely diffused throughout ancient Europe. The national enthusiasm of the northern antiquarians has too often outstripped their judgment, and many of the fanciful analogies of such really excellent authors as Perugakioled and Rudbuck must, unfortunately, be reckoned amongst the dreams of the learned; yet the truths which they have discovered may be easily se- parated from their delusions. Perhaps a Celtic origin may be ascribed to the tomb. Of the Celtic Taranus we know little; yet there are Roman inscriptions which show that he was worshipped as the Roman Jupiter. And it cannot be denied but that the deity whom the Romans knew as Jupiter was the thunderer of the Northmen. If the superincumbent body of peperino is to be considered as a proof the remote antiquity of the tomb, it must be referred to the Celtic aborigines of Italy ; but if the bed can be considered as a formation of comparatively recent date, then the vase may contain the ashes of some Gaulish chieftain or of a heathen Goth the ashes of some Gaulish chieftain or of a heathen Goth or Lombard.

It may be considered as a wild speculation to discover the traces of ancient mythology in a school- boy\u2019s scrawl; but a remarkable instance can be given of the strange stubborn vitality of these vestiges of the superstitions of the elder day. We often see English shepherds cutting the pentalpha in the turf, shepherds cutting the pentalpha  in the turf, although they never heard of Antiochus or saw his coin, and although they are ignorant of its mystic power. Sir William Jones, with his usual taste and research, has drawn a parallel between the deities of Meru and Olympus: and an enthusiast might, perhaps, maintain that the vases of Alba Longa were a relic of the times when one religion prevailed in Latium and Hind\u00fbstan. It is most singular that the Hind\u00fb cross is precisely the hammer of Thor. It may finally be observed, that, supposing the state of remote society to have existed which the Italian anti- quary assigns to the hill, and supposing these relics to have been suddenly overwhelmed by the volcano in those unknown ages, some other vestiges besides sepul- chral deposits would have been found to attest the same industry and skill in the arts which are manifested in these specimens.

The Letters of Rienzi addressed, during his residence in Bohemia, to Charles IV., Emperor of Germany, and to the Archbishop of Prague, certainly of Germany, and to the Archbishop of Prague, certainly add some new details to the strange history of the Tribune but they do not appear to alter in any material degree the previous estimate of his character. They do not make him a better or a wiser man than he is usually thought to have been\u2014rather the contrary; but they illustrate the character of the age and country in which Rienzi rose and fell.

The progress of time alone would naturally have pro- duced and obliterated many innovations, but the frequent domestic revolutions, the repeated irruptions, the arms and the arts of strangers, succeeding each other rapidly and imperceptibly, and bringing with them new laws, and manners, and opinions, have occasioned in Italy more vicissitudes than are to be found in the literature of any other country. Thus it is that their critics have been able to point out at least ten different epoques when it has assumed certain characteristics, or, to use a single word, \u00e0 physiognomy, altogether distinct from that of any pre- ceding or subsequent period. The average duration assigned to each of these epoques has been laid down at about half a century. This the utmost length that any individual taste and mode of writing can be discovered to have prevailed. The above remark is purposely premised to a short account which it is intended to give of the present state of Italian literature; that is to say, of the character of the actual epoque, which embraces not only those writers at present in existence, but others who have powerfully con- tributed to form the taste and the tone which will continue                              ",

The latter Italian authors may be expected to form a diversity more distinct than those of any other generation, when it is recollected that, whilst they wrote, the most extraordinary change was prepared and consummated that had ever affected the moral or poli- tical world. That the great convulsions which shook not only \u201c mightiest monarchies, but also the mind of man in all the countries of Europe, should communicate itself to these authors was inevitable, and will be discovered in the works, the principles, the character, and the estimation the works, the principles, the character, and the estimation of the most celebrated amongst them, whom it is proposed to examine and pourtray. These authors will be their poets; who are selected, first, because the verse of every country is the depository of the language, the taste, and the manners of the times; secondly, because this found the manners of the times; secondly, because this found more particularly the case in those nations whose ima- gination is their predominant faculty; and, in the third place, because the writers chosen on this occasion are in part distinguished for their compositions in prose. This method of illustration might be liable to objections in any other country than Italy, where the few men of sup\u00e9rior genius are separated from the crowd of writers by a barrier which, in other nations, is rarely visible until a barrier which, in other nations, is rarely visible until posterity has pronounced the final decision. In Italy the judgment is in some sort formed and given by their con- temporaries; and thus, although the struggle to attain the eminence may be more serious and protracted, there is less danger of future degradation. An intimate acquaintance is, however, requisite to per ceive the difference between the esteemed and the popular author; for, otherwise, the above-mentioned singularity of Italian literature would be reduced to a shade only of dis- tinction from that of other countries.

If we endeavour to account for this characteristic in the literature of Italy, a partial, or perhaps a sufficing, reason may be found in the difference between countries like Eng- land France, and one in which, as there is no single capital, there are, comparatively speaking, none of those court intrigues, none of those party passions, none of those fashionable cabals and tribunals, which are called into play and employed in Paris and London in deciding the fate of and employed in Paris and London in deciding the fate of authors. It is not that there are no reviews composed by the personal enemies or friends of the respective writers ; it is not that fashion has no voice; but the injustice of criticism or the folly of a coterie, which may sway the public opinion for awhile in one of the great cities, is inevitably corrected before it has run through the mass of disinterested readers and travelled the wide circle of Venice, Bologna, Parma, Verona, Milan, Turin, Florence, Naples, and Rome.

Bold, fruitful, eloquent, and deeply versed in ancient and modern literature, this writer impressed his readers with the conviction of his genius; and yet, although he resembled no one of his predecessors or contemporaries, there was something more of novelty or contemporaries, there was something more of novelty than originality in all his compositions. He was brought up in the ecclesiastical seminary of Padua, which prides itself, and with some justice, on the constancy and success with which it has preserved the latinity of the purer ages. Indeed, the Latin verses of Cesarotti are a proof no less of his talents than of the merit of this celebrated institution, which, had he continued to pursue the same studies, would have produced a new rival of Vida or Fracastorius. But he no sooner entered into holy orders and quitted the seminary than he declared war against the poets of antiquity, and more especially of * All of them now have been long dead.\u20141858.

An Englishman passing through Venice made him acquainted with Ossian, at that time the delight, or at least the wonder, of the transalpine critics, and Cesarotti lost no time in translating it into blank verse, accompany- ing his version with notes, for the most part, against Homer. Ossian delighted the Italians, who did not, generally speaking, embarrass themselves with the exa- mination of the authenticity of the pretended epic. Pal- mieri of Placentia, and a few others, ventured to contest the antiquity of the poet, but the mass of readers, seduced the antiquity of the poet, but the mass of readers, seduced by the authority of Blair, or by their inclination to be by the authority of Blair, or by their inclination to be pleased with their Italian Ossian, were resolved to discover the genuine son of Fingal in the spurious offspring of Mac the genuine son of Fingal in the spurious offspring of Mac pherson. Some there were who still defended the heroes of the old school, and exclaimed against a precedent fatal to the reputation of the ancient models and to the purity of to the reputation of the ancient models and to the purity of the modern language.

His verses, in truth, are har- monious, are soft, are imbued with a colouring, and breathe an ardent spirit altogether new; and, with the same ma an ardent spirit altogether new; and, with the same ma terials, he has created a poetry that appears written in a metre and a language entirely different from all former specimens. His superiority was evinced by the want of success in those who endeavoured to imitate him, and whose exaggerations and caricatures were received with a ridicule that, by little and little, was attached to their a ridicule that, by little and little, was attached to their model and partially diminished his fame. The translation of Ossian will, however, be always considered as an incon trovertible proof the genius of Cesarotti and of the flexibility of the Italian tongue.

This work is in ten large octavo volumes: each book is translated literally into Italian prose, and almost every passage is illustrated by the compared opinions of the critics of every nation, from Aristarchus to those of our own days. He invariably cites the adversaries of Homer and often opposes them with the partisans of the poet. When he subjoins his own decision, it very rarely inclines to the favour of his original. To every book thus translated and commented upon he adds his own poetical version, which, as it was intended to correct the errors discovered in the original, changes, omits, and transfers from one book to another whole pas- sages of the text. These alterations were so many and so material that, in the end, he resolved to change the title of the poem, and his Iliad reappeared as the Death of Hector.

This the only work of Cesarotti\u2019s that has preserved its original reputation up to this day. The author himself abused, however, the privi- lege which he claimed for all writers; and in one of the reviews then most esteemed in Italy, it was asserted that the preacher of liberty had awakened a spirit of licentious- ness, and yet might easily raise himself to the dictatorship.* The truth was, that Cesarotti was, by his partisans, re- garded as infallible, and was the terror of his opponents, whose censure was confined to the adoption of a practioe contrary to his powerful example. His prose is endowed with all the qualities that consti- tute a superior writer.

Mazza, besides his poetical reputa- tion, had the character of a scholar profoundly versed in ancient and modern languages, and the acquisition of the latter is the more singular, as he had never been out of Italy, and indeed had seldom quitted his native town.* JOSEPH PARINI. Parini was almost the only Italian poet of the last century who dared to conceive, and certainly he was the only one who was capable of completing, the project of directing the efforts of his art towards the improvement of his fellow- citizens. If by moralizing his song he has failed to correct his contemporaries, he has, however, acquired a reputation much more valuable than can be the share of those whose talents are devoted solely to the amusement of the public. His parents were peasants on the borders of the lake Pusiano, the Eupilis of Pliny, about twenty miles to the north of Milan. It is usual in Italy to choose from the poorest classes those destined to supply the humblest and most laborious duties in the church, whilst the valuable benefices are reserved for the younger sons of noble families.

His whole livelihood and that of an aged mother, were derived from composing articles for a newspaper.

He had already published some poetry which had dropt after the partial applauses that usually succeed the first essays of every author, that are not bad enough for ridicule nor good enough for envy. Parini would never allow these specimens to be reprinted. It was not until his thirty-fifth year that he published the first canto of that poem, which rendered him formidable to the most powerful families around him, and established him in the eyes of the literary world as the founder of anew school in poetry.

At that time they were important from their influ- ence, direct and indirect, and formidable from the impunity with which they could give a loose to their revenge. It is universally known that before the revolution the Italian nobles enjoyed a sort of prescriptive right of em- ploying assassins ; but it is more wonderful still, that this day, and in the face of the new noblesse created by Bonaparte, there is not a single instance of the daughte or wife of any but those in possession of ancient titles being admitted to the ball-room or drawing-room of a Milanese patrician.

But even in this department of his art, which an Englishman would abandon as hope- less, our author contrived to give an air of reality to his classical fables, by applying them to the practices and principles of his own times. Thus it is that his Cupid and Hymen are introduced. They are engaged in a war to all appearance interminable, but they agree to treat, and to all appearance interminable, but they agree to treat, and peace is made on condition that Cupid shall reign all day and Hymen all night. An English reader would not be much struck with this invention; but whoever meets a handsome Italian matron, decently pacing between hei husband her cavalier servente, will instantly remember the Love and Hymen of Parini, and the graceful solemn the Love and Hymen of Parini, and the graceful solemn air with which his verses march majestically along Our own nation can hardly have a just idea of this species of poetry. The Italians who admire it the most compare it to the \u201c Georgics;\u2019 and the \u201cGiorno has certainly more than one property in common with the poem of Virgil.

Treatises upon the fine arts, and more particularly the lives of celebrated artists, were his favourite and constant study. Amongst the few books which he possessed at the time of his death, his executors found two copies of Vasari\u2019s Biography,' both of them worn away by repeated perusal. He never applied either to drawing or to music, but he was perfectly well acquainted with the theory, and sensible to the charms, of both, and the most celebrated professors had frequent recourse to his advice. His post- humous works furnish us with the ideas, the composition, and even the details of several pictures which he had com- municated to distinguished artists, and which are now to be seen, faithfully executed according to his directions, in many of the palaces at Milan. Parini employed, indeed, bis whole life in carrying into practice the maxim that poetru should be painting ; for, with the exception of Dante, the other Italian poets have only occasional pictures : all the rest is but description.

Another of the same class, I Viaggi,' is devoted to the censure of himself, and of the nobility, and of those who travel for want of occupation. This satire is in terza rima, and is the best specimen of that harshness of versification which the warmest admirers of Alfieri allow to be indefensible. He was seduced into this error by a wish to shun the opposite defect which characterised the poets of the preceding generation. The plant had been so warped and drawn to the earth on one side by Metastasio, that Alfieri thought he could never recovei its position without bending it backwards as much on the other. The tree is not yet upright. Yet his strange words, and his capricious innovations in phraseology, profusely as they are spread over his satires and his comedies, will be forgotten or forgiven, and the force and purity of his diction will ever recommend the prose of Alfieri to the study of his countrymen. It is worthy of remark, that the Paris edition of his tragedies, which he printed at the press of Didot, is of his tragedies, which he printed at the press of Didot, is partially exempt from that harshness of versification observ- able in all his former editions. The errors of a man of genius are not unfrequently of service to the cause of literature. Mr. Bellotto, in his translation of Sophocles, chose Alfieri for his model, as far as regarded his method and general style; but he softened the diction, he harmonised the numbers of his prototype the diction, he harmonised the numbers of his prototype and thus succeeded in producing a work which had been long expected, and often essayed in vain. Alfieri, a little after the year 1790, and before his return to Italy, printed at Kell some specimens of lyrical poetry in two volumes. The first contains an ode on the taking of the Bastille, and a poem, comprising five odes on the emancipation of America. The one addressed to Washing- ton is the best; but bespeaks, after all, only the originality of the poet.

The Marquis John Pindemonte, eldest brother of him who will be here treated of, is a proof the preliminary observation that a man of literature may be very popular in Italy, and yet be without that settled reputation which owes its origin to the suffrages of the learned class of readers. This nobleman, in conjunction with Pepoli, kept for some time possession of the stage.  The tragedies of John Pinde- monte, which are now almost forgotten, brought crowds to the theatre at the time that Alfieri was listened to with the theatre at the time that Alfieri was listened to with impatience.

It is, however, a fact which any one will verify by a careful inquiry, that the poetry of Hip- politus Pindemonte is not relished by the generality of readers, who are nevertheless obliged to repeat his praises, having been taught that lesson by the learned distributors of literary fame, and by those who are by tacit consent allowed to possess the most cultivated taste. The same obedient crowd throng the play-houses to see the tragedies of his elder brother: but the fear of the same censors pre\u00ac of his elder brother: but the fear of the same censors pre\u00ac vents them from praising the composition of their favourite dramas. Hippolitus has also written a tragedy on the death of Arminius, the German hero, whose conspiracy against the liberties of his country was punished with death from the hand of his own relations. The style of this piece is much applauded; the plan of it is on the model of Shakespeare without, however, a total abandonment of those ancient rules which the Italians will allow no writer to violate with impunity. He has introduced chorusses sung by young warriors and maidens, and has thus combined, with some success, the English, the Greek, and the Italian drama: as to the French plan, the example and the system of Alfieri have created a persuasion that it is irreconcileable with the Italian theatre. Whether the' Arminius\u2019 has stood the great test does not appear in the published play. Perhaps it has been never acted, and perhaps it may be as little it has been never acted, and perhaps it may be as little qualified for any stage as the \u2019 Caractacus\u2019 and the \u201c Elfrida would be for our own. The works of Pindemonte which are most esteemed are some lyrical poems, and particularly his epistles in verse. These last contain a happy assemblage of qualities not easily combined. The Italians behold in them the amenity of Horace, the tenderness of Petrarch, and a certain gravity of ideas and sentiments, for which, perhaps, he is indebted to his acquaintance with English poetry.

Monti then was the tragic writer of Italy, and was confidently hailed as the successful candi- date for an eminence as yet never occupied. He afterwards published two other tragedies : \u201c Galeotto Manfredi,' which is not only far below his Aristodemus, but beneath the talents of the author, and \u201c Caius Gracchus.

The defects of Monti\u2019s tragedies are reducible to the insignificance of his characters, to the irre- gularity of his plot, and to a style sometimes too lyrical, sometimes too tame. These were discovered by the audi- ence, and perhaps by the poet, for he laid no further claim to the throne of Melpomene.

The diffi- culty of handling a contemporary topic was not too great for the capacity of Monti, and had he continued his Basville to the victory of Waterloo, he might have occupied, next to Dante, that place which Virgil possesses not far from Homer. The voyage of the angel with the shade of Basville is taken from that of Dante with the spirit of Virgil. The terze rime, a metre perfected by the father of Italian poetry, was, in the true sense of the word, ennobled (ingentilito) by Monti. It is true that he has not the same harmonious variety, nor the same boldness of expression, nor the same loftiness of thought as are found in his model. But he is more equal, more clear, more finished in every part: his more equal, more clear, more finished in every part: his images have not only the stable grandeur, but even the glossy whiteness of Parian sculpture; and although they succeed each other with astonishing rapidity, and force, and boldness, preserve an elegance peculiar to themselves, more especially in the terze rime, which no one has ever employed with the same success. It is probable that Monti will never be surpassed in this metre: but in the heroic stanza he could not come into the field against Ariosto and Tasso; and in blank verse, Cesarotti, Parini, and Foscolo have been more adventurous and more successful. Monti had scarcely published the fourth canto of his poem (which, such as he left it, does not amount to 1500 lines) when the French conquered Lombardy.

Hugo Foscolo was at that time a youth, but not too young to profit by the friendship and the example of his distin- guished contemporaries. The total change in the political condition of his country, his military education, and the part which he played in public affairs, developed, however. his talents, and formed his character in a manner quite dif- his talents, and formed his character in a manner quite dif- ferent from that of his predecessors: besides, the circum- stances under which he wrote arrived too late to form their style, and being now gone by, may perhaps require a course of ages to reproduce. Foscolo laid it down for a principle that Italian poetry had expired with Tasso, and had been re-resuscitated only had expired with Tasso, and had been re-resuscitated only in the present day. Hear his own words: * Senza l\u2019Ossian del Cesarotti, Il Giorno del Parini, Vittorio Alfieri, e Vincenzo Monti, la nostra poesia si giacerebbe tuttavia sepolta con le ceneri di Torquato Tasso. Da indi in qu\u00e0 un secolo la inorpell\u00f2, e l\u2019 altro la immiseri. L\u2019Ossian pu\u00f2 far dare nello la inorpell\u00f2, e l\u2019 altro la immiseri. L\u2019Ossian pu\u00f2 far dare nello strano; il Parini nel leceato ; l\u2019Alfieri nell\u2019 aspro; e il Monti nell ornato: ma le umane virt\u00f9 non fruttano senza l\u2019innesto d\u2019un vizio, I grandi ingegni emuleranno: i mezzani scimiotterrano : e colorc che esplorano i propri meriti nelle altrui colpe, si getteranno simili a corvi sovra le piaghe de\u2019 generosi cavalli. This passage, extracted from his Preface to an experi\u00ac ment for translating the Iliad, printed at Brescia in 1807. may serve for a specimen of his style and of his literary opinions. He commenced his career a year before the fall of the Venetian republic, with a tragedy called Thyestes. Being angry at the little attention paid by the Venetians to the tragedies of Alfieri, and at the corrupted taste which made them prefer and applaud those of the Marquis Pin- demonte and of Count Pepoli, he resolved that his drama should have only four personages; and that the simplicity and severity of his whole composition should rival Alfieri and the Greek tragedians.

The courage and the youth of the author enabled him to triumph over his rivals, and his Thyestes received more applause than perhaps it deserved. The actors published it in the tenth volume of the ? Teatre Italiano Applaudito,' subjoining to it an account of its great success, and a criticism written in favour of the author. Foscolo himself adopted the extraordinary pro- ceeding of publishing a severe censure of his own work, the success of which he attributed solely to its conformity with the great models of antiquity. The pamphlet was ill received by the public, and the Venetians painted the por- trait of the young poet in the drop-curtain of the F\u00e9nice Theatre, among those who had a better claim to this dis- tinction. The Thyestes\u2019 is still occasionally acted, and is sustained by the warmth of the dialogue and the strength of the dramatic passions, but the style is so harsh as to be insupportable to the reader. The learned of Italy speak neither well nor ill of the Letters of Ortis,' which, however, has been more fre- quently reprinted in his own country than any other of Foscolo\u2019s works, and is certainly much more known on the other side of the Alps. The Germans have exhausted upon this little book all the metaphysics of criticism ; they have translated it twice, and a certain professor Luden has accompanied his version with a whole volume of disserta- tions. After all, it is but an imitation of Werter. There is, however, this striking difference, that the object of the Italian is solely political. There is indeed something for all tastes in the politics, and the poetry, and the love of Ortis. The allusions to the downfall of the Venetian republic, and the introduction of living interlocutors, such as Parini at Milan, give a reality to the fable which must be highly interesting to the Italians, and is attractive even to strangers.

The little dog of the lady who falls in love with Ortis may be mentioned as one. The author is in his proper element when he breaks forth into his ethical re- flections: how truly he says, \u201c That we are too proud to give our compassion when we feel we can give nothing give our compassion when we feel we can give nothing else.' The love of Ortis is, perhaps, the least interesting portion of the work; there is not importance enough attached to his existence to make it natural that so much importance should be attached to his end. It was difficult, perhaps, to give many attractions to the adventures of an obscure to give many attractions to the adventures of an obscure politician; but it is still possible that those of an age and sex more accessible to the tender feelings may be touched by the misfortunes and the heroic despair of the Italian Werter. But Ortis\u2019 may boast of having been the first book that induced the females and the mass of readers to interest themselves in public affairs. This was a mighty exploit in a country where one maxim had been for ages the groundwork of education for all classes of society, De Deo parum, de Principe nihil. It is difficult at this day to find in Italy an edition of the \u201c Letters of Ortis altogether exempt from those mutilations which the revisors of one kind or another have inflicted on this romance. In spite, however, of all their prudent efforts, it has been found im- possible to emasculate every page which launches forth invectives against the corruption of the old government, against the foreign usurpation of the new, and lastly against the treachery with which the French general bought and the treachery with which the French general bought and sold the republic of Venice. Chiari and Piazza, and other common writers, had before published some hundreds of romances, which had been the delight only of the vulgar reader; for those of a more refined taste had resorted to the foreign novels.

Others, and they are the majority, terrified by the study of a language the abundance of whose words and the variety a language the abundance of whose words and the variety of whose combinations render it almost insuperable, affect that sort of style now so common throughout Europe, which they are pleased to call philosophical, and which, in fact, is but a jargon neither Italian nor French, but a bad mixture but a jargon neither Italian nor French, but a bad mixture of both. If, therefore, good writers are rare in all countries they are more especially so in Italy; for they have to connect the generic characteristics constantly inherent for five cen- turies in the Italian language, with the specific character- istics of their own times; and this amalgamation, not depending upon any fixed rules, must be contrived solely by the individual talents of each author. This accounts for the surprising diversity which foreigners are apt to for the surprising diversity which foreigners are apt to observe in the manner of writing employed by the various authors of the same age; and perhaps this same diversity is more remarkable in the prose of Foscolo than of other writers. The Italian author also makes it an article of faith to vary his style according to his subject. Thus there is no less a difference between the letters, the romances, and the orations, than between the history and the epic or and the orations, than between the history and the epic or lyric poetry of these varied compositions. The Ortis' and the 'Sentimental Journey\u2019 resemble each other very little; notwithstanding that the author has followed the same rules of composition, and has always preserved the traits peculiar to his style.

After describing the distress of his country, the speaker, who calls himself Giovine non affatto libero, proposes certain remedies, and those he would apply not only to Italy, but to maintain the renown of that hero whose future glory he declares to depend principally on the durable independence of a nation which he had rescued from the slavery and disgrace of ages.

This discourse is not more than eighty pages, and, not- withstanding it is an historical composition, maintains a certain impetuosity and gravity of style which overwhelm and fatigue the attention.

This brevity might be agreeable to those who had been spectators of, or actors in, the short and transitory scene; but foreign readers, and even those Italians removed by time or place from the original action, are left in the dark.

We should call this pedantry; but it appears a meritorious exploit in the eves of a nation, which, having for two hundred years diluted its language to insipidity, now lays it down for a maxim that for the graces of style, the early Tuscan authors are to be consulted; and for the strength, and, if the word may be used, the nobility of the language, the Latins are the only safe model. It must be confessed that the origin of the language admits of this union. It is not unnatural that when they would discourse of liberty, they should have recourse to the manner of their Roman ancestors. Bonaparte, at the Congress of Lyons, changed the name of the Cisalpine into that of the Italian Republic. He of the Cisalpine into that of the Italian Republic. He appointed himself president of this new state, and promul- gated a constitution which he continued to violate at will up to the other change which converted the Republic into a Kingdom, and placed the administration of Upper Italy a Kingdom, and placed the administration of Upper Italy in the hands of a French viceroy. The only effect of Fos- colo\u2019s discourse was to stop his own military promotion, but the loss of fortune was more than compensated by the public gratitude, which pointed to him as the man who had spoken the sense of the people, who had told the courageous truth, and had stood forward as the champion of national independence. It seems, however, that he continued in the army some time after this effort. The date of the preface to his \u201c Sentimental Journey\u2019 shows that he was, in 1805, at Calais with one of the Italian regiments which Bonaparte had united to his Army of England. His dedica- tion of the works of Montecuculi, published in 1808 and 1809, which is addressed to General Caffarelli, minister of war of the Italian kingdom, tells us that he was aide-de- camp to that officer. Foscolo published his edition of Montecuculi in two vo- lumes, in folio, from the manuscripts discovered in the archives of the last Prince Trivulzio, by Serassi, the bio- grapher of Tasso, and more recently by other inquirers.

The object of Foscolo was more than literary; he wished, by the example and precepts of an illustrious fellow-citizen, to inspire the Italians with a por- tion of his martial spirit, as well as to replace the author in his due rank amongst the best classical writers. He placed Montecuculi by the side of Machiavelli, and the compressed commanding style of the great rival of Turenne facilitated the labours of his editor in filling up the many blanks of the manuscript. Foscolo was commended for these supplements, and for his happy imitation of the ori- ginal style ; but he was accused of having been too licen- tious in his emendations of the text.\u201c Montecuculi wrote his commentaries and his military aphorisms when the use of artillery was but imperfectly known, and when a great part both of the infantry and cavalry fought with pikes and halberds, and the principal object of every war was the attack and defence of fortified towns. Foscolo illustrated his author with notes of two kinds\u2014some of them consisting of passages from the classics, serving to show the Greek and Roman art of war, and the others relating to the system of Frederic II. and of Napoleon. By this plan the editor meant to apply each precept of Montecuculi to the three principal epochs in the history of military art\u2014the ancient, the middle, and the modern period. To each volume he subjoined dissertations written with precisely the same object : he calls Napoleon il mag- giore querriero delle et\u00e0 moderne, an eulogium which must be allowed far from extravagant, at the time that the two senates of France and of Italy declared him the Thunderer of the Earth (\u201c Jupiter foudroyant sur la terre\"), and all the kings of Europe confessed the title to be fairly earned and duly bestowed. * Ha supplito alle lacune con lo stile del Montecucoli: ma Mon- tecucoli nel proprio testo parla spesso con lo stile di Foscolo.\u2014See Giornale della Societ\u00e0 d\u2019 Incorraggiamento, an. 1809.

Foscolo retained his chair only two months; and about twenty-four other professors, who had not involved themselves in the guilt of preaching his principles, were also deprived of their emoluments, after many years of literary labour. It would be hazardous to say whether the discourse of Foscolo provoked this measure, or whether it had been some time in agitation; but at all events, the Italians were struck with the verification of the words of their own Alfieri, who had told them that absolute monarchs hate the historian, and the poet, and the orator, and give preference to the sciences.+ Perhaps it may not be uncharitable to add to the sciences.+ Perhaps it may not be uncharitable to add * On this occasion the celebrated Mezzofanti, professor of Oriental languages, and the most extraordinary linguist in exist- ence, was deprived of his chair, and reduced to an income of 750 francs. f See the article on Alfieri. f See the article on Alfieri.

A strict propriety in the words, a severe grammatical exactness, and a scrupulous rejection of every thing not absolutely inherent in the genius of the language\u2014these meritorious characteristics are apparent in every page; but on the other hand, the same composition is remarkable for an unusual method of connecting the phrases ; for the perilous bold- ness of the metaphors; for the over-nice discrimination of the expressions, and the use of them in the primitive of the expressions, and the use of them in the primitive Tuscan sense in contradistinction to their modern accep- tation. It evinces also a certain confusion of imagery with argument, a continual struggle between the natural impe- tuosity and the affected calm of the writer; a union of objects very different in themselves, which are distin- guished by a variety of colouring that dazzles and con- founds the eye; and lastly, a crowd of ideas which, together with the rapidity of expression, overwhelm and fatigue the attention.

In England these demonstrations of contempt would be suspected, and would be ridiculous; and even in Italy Mr. Foscolo has been justly charged with pushing them to an unjust exposure of men who were the most disposed to be his literary friends and admirers.

To him she owed her union; to him, her laws and her arms: her new activity, and her recovered martial spirit, were inspired by his system. But Foscolo was a citizen of the Venetian republic which Napoleon destroyed, and there exists in Italy a very numerous class, who consider the independence of their country as the first indispensable step towards her re- generation.

That he was offended I had subsequently a painful proof for when I requested the co-operation of several distin- guished contemporaries of Lord Byron towards erecting a monument to his memory, Pindemonti was the only man who not only gave me a refusal, but replied to me in terms deficient in courtesy and Christian candour. He forgot that if any blame was to be attached to the request, I was the culprit, and not Lord Byron. The readers of the Essay will observe that it relates chiefly to natives of Upper Italy, and that several writers of eminence belonging to other portions of the peninsula of eminence belonging to other portions of the peninsula are not noticed in its pages. It was, indeed, my intention to have continued these biographical sketches, by adding to them similar accounts of Betinelli, Nicolini, Giusti, and others (embracing, perhaps, the famous Leopardi), who have attained to eminence since my first acquaintance with Italy ; but the friend above alluded to discontinued his assistance, and another person to whom 1 looked for valu- able help, and who kindly promised to give it to me, was                                       ",

The Cavalier Cosimo Buonarotti was the representative of a family made illustrious by a man of a genius almost of a family made illustrious by a man of a genius almost universal, and which none but Italians of all modern na- tions have been found to possess. He lived in the house where Michael Angelo had lived: he was possessed of several unpublished manuscripts, some of them autographs, of his great ancestor; and, with a taste highly cultivated, and manners most engaging, was one of the chief ornaments I was honoured by his personal in- of Florentine society. timacy, and by his correspondence, for many years; and he furnished me when at Florence, in 1842, with some notices, both in conversation and by written documents, which would have been of considerable service to me if he had been able to continue his contributions; but he received a high judicial appointment, and subsequently became one of the ministers of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. I saw him the ministers of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. I saw him in 1854 in that character, and could not help remarking in 1854 in that character, and could not help remarking that both he and I had been somewhat diverted from those pursuits to which I had been indebted for my long intimacy with him. He was, however, changed in nothing but per- sonal appearance. I found him the same friendly, urbane pleasing-mannered gentleman that had greeted me in 1817. But he is gone; nor is there one of all those who made my first residence in Italy so delightful to me now left to re- ceive this assurance of my grateful recollection of them. It is almost superfluous to add that I leave the under- taking which I had hoped to complete to younger and to abler hands; but it may surprise some readers to hear that present there is no such general review of the actual state of Italian literature.
