Here we enjoyed some wonderful rambles among the woods, and along the steep banks of the river, and up to the hoary fortresses that reflect themselves in the bright water beneath. Thence we proceeded to Mayence, and to the old imperial city of Frankfort. Here, after a night’s rest, we had just time to visit the old market-place, where the country people sold their fruit and vege- tables, under the shadow of the tall ancient house, from which Luther used to preach. Then we drove through the Jews' Quarter. The high pitched roofs and projecting upper stories of the dim old houses quite darken the street. At twelve, we were on our way to Nuremberg. NUREMBERG.

High gables, minarets, oriel windows, watch towers and shrines, crowd before you. The large sloping roofs are covered with pinnacled windows and ornamental chimneys, crowned by gilded spire and ball.

The small river Pegnitz, intersecting the town, is crossed by many small bridges, some of which are built upon; from others you get highly picturesque views of ancient dwellings on the banks—whose projecting gables, browned by age, bend over the rapid and muddy stream. The wall surrounding the city is also highly fantastic; numberless towers rise from it of every shape and size, each roofed with red tile it of every shape and size, each roofed with red tile in a most quaint and ornamental manner. in a most quaint and ornamental manner. Nuremberg formed part of the Hanseatic League and long flourished as a free imperial city.

The turrets and towers of these ramparts are wonderfully curious in their varied forms; they are built in every grotesque shape conceivable. We visited a brass foundry, where a monument to Radetsky is being cast. This man, whom I believe we justly hold in abhorrence, is surrounded by a group of soldiers, among whom is a Tyrolean, with his deeply slouched hat.

In 1368, the populace rose against the patricians and established a democratic government, which lasted one hundred and sixty years. Then the aristocracy abetted by Charles the fifth, regained the ascendency. Notwithstanding the democratic ten- dencies of this old city, it was a favourite resort of the emperors. Maximilian enjoyed dancing with the rich burghers’ wives and their comely daughters. As he turned to get a last glance of the city on his way he turned to get a last glance of the city on his way to Innspruck, where a mortal illness seized him—he exclaimed “ Well, the Lord bless thee my own fair Augsburg! We have had many a joyous day in thee, and now we shall never see thee again.\" I wish we could have remained here a day, and seen the episcopal palace, where Luther, after his weary the episcopal palace, where Luther, after his weary walk from Nuremberg, appeared before Cajetan, the Pope’s legate, to answer for the first time, the charge of heresy.

A few days afterwards, the famous Confession, written by Melancthon, embodying the doctrines of the reformers, was read by the chan- cellor of Saxony, before the assembled diet.

The elector’s argument pre- vailed. The Confession was subsequently printed in many other tongues, and distributed all over Europe. It is still the basis of belief in the Lutheran church. 5’ While Charles deliberated, Garcia de Loaysa wrote thus—“ Bring back Germany by gifts and flatteries to the leaders of the reformers, by imperial edicts to the people, who, if they will not obey, the true rhubarb the people, who, if they will not obey, the true rhubarb to heal them is force.

Schärtlin, commander of the forces against the emperor, and a true son of Augsburg, would still have held out, and could have done so, but Fugger have held out, and could have done so, but Fugger and others of the aristocracy sneaked out from the walls, replenished the emperor’s purse, and made terms with the despot.

Magdeburg especially opened her arms to all Protestant refugees, and four hundred ministers emigrated from Augsburg, Ulm, and other parts of southern Germany.

In the olden days, when bibles were rare, they who possessed the precious volume perhaps thus expressed their veneration and love. Like the woman of whose alabaster box of ointment Jesus said, that wherever the gospel should be preached it should be told as a memorial of her, their gift became an acceptable offering, as with grateful hearts they placed each rounded pearl and glittering gem on the casket containing the words which had given life and light to their souls.

When the persecutions of the Protestants darkened the history of this lovely district, the miners, who were hunted from their beloved vallies by the Jesuits, closed up the entrance to many of the mines, and hid them so effectually, they have never since been found. Other mines are lost by the avalanches which descend and cover them. One in particular was thus overwhelmed many years ago, and forty men were bu- ried in its narrow passages. The snow has melted away this summer so much, that hopes are entertained of discovering the entrance. Alas! the poor miners in their silent vault, will hail no more the returning light nor join the wild song of the merry mountaineer. Mr. G. told us that a cottage buried beneath an avalanche two hundred years ago, was during the excessive heat of this summer exposed to view. Among the ruins were found the bodies of two men in a state of perfect preservation ! a state of perfect preservation !

Shedding many tears, the brave child was taken to Munich, where the king gave him a good education. In happier times he was restored to his father.

Impressed with the bold and impetuous character of these fear- less mountaineers, as well as the vast importance in a military point of view of their country, to the defence of the hereditary states, the Austrians not only never made any attempt to infringe their privileges, but treated the inhabitants with such lenity, that they knew government only by the protection and benefits which it afforded. The taxes were so light as to be almost imperceptible; civil appointments were almost all filled by natives; municipal officers were elected by the people ; custom-house restraints were hardly felt; the conscription was unknown. Four battalions of light-armed troops were all that was required by government from the province, though it contained seven hundred thousand souls. Such was the land which in 1805 was, by the treaty of Presburg, delivered over to Bavaria.

The prince- bishop of Trent offered to give up the see of Brixen. In 1547, the first session closed on account of an epidemic then raging, and was re-opened at Bologna. Charles the fifth, the great promoter of the council, insisted on its being continued in Trent. It was therefore adjourned, and again convoked here in 1551. Many Protestants were then present—among whom we read of ambassadors from Maurice, elector of Saxony, and from the elector of Brandenburg, and of Queen divines from Wittenberg and Augsburg. Elizabeth declined sending delegates, preferring to abide by the decision of the English convocation. The council was again prorogued, and not resumed until January 1562. There were many debates regarding the partaking of the communion in both kinds, and as to the marriage of the clergy, and their residence in their own dioceses. Many practical measures of reform were adopted, one of the most important of which was the suppression of the quæstors—men who to gather “ alms\"’ for the church, were sent from Rome to different countries proclaiming indulgences. St. Peter’s was partly erected by the money thus gained.                                "

They also urged a clear defi- nition of the doctrines regarding the use of images. relics, and indulgences. Renaud Ferrier, the presi- dent of the parliament in Paris, laid these requests before the reverend fathers, proclaiming eloquently the necessity for reform, and reminding them of the holy Ambrose, Augustine, and Chrysostom.

Charles the ninth wrote to approve Ferrier’s conduct, and to condemn the cardinal of Lorraine for taking part against Fer- rier, and for his increased leaning to the Roman court. Among the many questions discussed, that of the reading of religious books and the treatment of here- tics deserves principal notice from us.

It was also decreed that no one should print, sell, or keep “ any books whatever on sacred matters, unless first approved of by the ordinary, under pain of the ana- thema, and fine, imposed in a canon of the last council of Lateran.“ The decree thus endorsed at Trent, was made by Leo X. and his council, in 1515.

We skirted the small lake of Doblino whose waters were clear and pleasant-looking amid the somewhat desolate scenery. The shadow of a battle- mented castle, old and gray, was reflected on its smooth surface. The Lombard rebels were forced back from here in 1848. The valley became more The mountains had scarcely a blade of barren. verdure, and large tracts of the plain they enclosed were covered with rocky debris, resembling the mo- raines of glaciers.

We thought eggs the safest things to order, but alas ! instead of being boiled, they were made into a horrible sort of hash! The coffee and milk came up in greasy copper-jugs. We endeavoured to take our meal, we were so faint—but one taste sufficed! Glad we were to leave the dreary village. We wonder why we were to leave the dreary village. We wonder why such a spot should have been chosen to build upon, and what is the inducement to live there. At length we came to Arco, where an ancient castle, surrounded by some dark cypress-trees, over- hangs the town. The perpendicular cliff on which it stands, is five hundred feet high. It is surprising how a castle could be erected in such a position. The valley becomes wider and more fruitful. Vine- yards, and fields of Indian corn irrigated by artificial streams, line both sides of our road ; but the vines are almost all blighted, and the withered bunches of fruit hang dismally among yellow leaves. The houses we pass are all dreary and dirty. The upper story is left open, and is usually stuffed with dead mulberry- branches. I was wearied with the desolation, and felt glad to meet some trucks laden with iron for the projected railway up the valley. Jealously as we look at the steam-engine rushing through beautiful and secluded scenes, we are thankful for its cheerful whiz in vallies like this.                                "

The mists still lingered, but the sun shone, and each moment the scene brightened. We had just time to dress and fasten up our boxes before the porter came to carry them to the steamer. There was a cheerful bustle on the little wharf. The glancing water, and the blue sky, and the gleaming houses, contrasted with the sombre tone of everything last evening. On board, all was matter-of-fact as on a Thames steamer. Everything was clean and trim. The deck and seats, just washed and mopped, were not vet dry.

When the clock struck six, the paddle wheels moved, and we were off. Warmed by breakfast, and by the sun which now was shining brilliantly, we rejoiced in the beautiful lake and the glorious moun- tains between which we sailed. A-head, the water widened and the mountains sank, as though we were approaching the sea. The slopes were now cultivated with the citron and vine; and fruitful gardens, with their many rows of white columns, climbed up the steeps. Little colonies of white-washed houses were nestling here and there. How fiercely the sun must strike those steeps!

It was built by Cangrande the second, at the time when he erected the castle adjoining. The latter is much modern- ized, and is used now as barracks for the Austrian troops. The view from the old bridge is beautiful. The rushing stream below, brings to mind how the people of Verona, to escape the depredations the people of Verona, to escape the depredations of the fierce German soldiery, built a frail bridge outside their city for the passage of the emperor Barbarossa, when he was retreating from Rome- and how it was broken by the pine-trees that were swept down the rapid river, too late to fulfil the * Paradise Regained.

From out the confusion which thus arose, sprang the republics, among which was Verona. In the twelfth century it joined the Lombard league of free cities. The annual election of the captains of the people degenerated into the rule of hereditary tyrants, and thus this city fell under the power of the Scaligers The Visconti wrenched it from them, and Carrara in his turn took possession of it, after which it became part of Venetia, and fell at last into the hands of Napoleon Buonaparte.

Having gained great victories over the Genoese, he was urged against his judgment to attack once more a fleet superior to his own. He lost the battle. The council re-called him. Long jealous of his popularity, they found in his defeat a pretext for his imprisonment.

The emperor again found means of communicating with him, and forwarded his imperial signature to a document which ceded the island of Tenedos to Venice, on condition of Zeno liberating him.

They have come to pray that Alexander may be restored to the pontifical throne. The figures of the ambassadors are very grand as they stand in their golden flowing robes. Their noble bearing indicates the spirit which they manifested on receiving the emperor’s answer, that if they did not deliver up the fugitive pope he would plant his standard on St. Mark’s. Only two courses remained; to abandon the pope or pre- pare for hostilities. They chose the latter.

We next examined a series of pictures illustrating some of the stirring events of the fourth crusade. Its leaders applied to Venice to ship their armament. The Venetians consented on condition of receiving eighty-five thousand marks (amounting to £170,000) and half of all the spoils. They also promised to fürnish at their own expense fifty galleys. When all was ready, the crusaders, who had assembled in great numbers, could not raise the required sum. The Venetians were inexorable.

Had it not been overthrown by the French, it would pro- bably have speedily dissolved in the maturity of its own corruptions. After Napoleon’s troops entered Venice, many be- lieved the republic would still continue to exist although under the protection of the French. Vain belief! In four months Venice was transferred to Austria under the treaty of Campo Formio. Napoleon wrote a letter offering an asylum in France to those who did not like to live under Austrian rule.

Her founders—men who had the old Roman blood rünning in their veins, purged and cleansed by adver- sity—formed a government thirteen hundred years ago, broad, liberal, and vigorous. “ For a thousand years they fought for life, for three hundred they invited death: their battle was rewarded, and their call was heard.\" Poor old doge Manin ! his death was more noble than his life. He could not brook the humiliation to which he had consented. He broke a blood-vessel as he signed the oath of allegiance to Austria. The old Venetian blood in him then burst forth. Weak and degenerated, it was still impossible for one who had worn the ducal crown to live subject to another monarch. Manin who in 1848 struggled so nobly to free Venice from her oppressors, was a member of the same family. But, as Daru says,—“ The ulte- rior vicissitudes of this nation belong to the history „2 of another people!

A deserter having informed the Venetians that the cella of the Par- thenon was converted into a powder-magazine, they hurled a shell at it, and the beautiful monument that for upwards of two thousand years had told of the grandeur of the old Greeks, was shattered into hope- less ruin. The Venetian commander seemed half ashamed of the destruction he had wrought, and took care to remind his comrades that he had opposed the desire of attacking Athens. The mischief being done, he resolved to enrich Venice with some trophy of his victory. Endeavouring to remove from the façade of the great temple the statue of Jupiter, and some the great temple the statue of Jupiter, and some magnificent horses in relievo, the whole mass came down with a terrific crash rendering the devastation complete.

The Turks, so often the bitter foes of Venice, once served her a good turn in a trading capacity. The republic was under a papal interdict. All nations acknowledging the pope seized the merchandise she had sent to their ports, confiscated their vessels, and in some cases massacred the sailors. “ Happy for us,\" says the Venetian historian, “that the Saracens were not baptized, and that our ships in their ports were respected in the usual manner.

Padua was attached to the Guelph party, and aided Vicenza in resisting Eccel- lino. Padua had reason to fear the neighbourhood of so bloody a tyrant. The people chose as their leader, a Venetian of the house of Badoer named Marino, but the aristocracy were the first to desert their country’s cause, and opened the gates to Eccel- lino. Bitterly were they punished. No sooner had his troops entered than he imprisoned all the high families and destroyed their dwellings.

Blinded by fury, he was fighting his way to Milan when he was wounded and taken pri- soner. He tore the bandages from his wounds and died in eleven days. Padua now enjoyed freedom for fifty-seven years, and recovered its prosperity. Vicenza became subject to it. In 1317 Cane della Scala, lord of Verona, threatened to take Padua.

When Francesco Carrara was besieged here by the Venetians, forty thousand perished from the pestilence occasioned by the rural population seeking shelter within the walls and thus over-crowding the city. Between Venice and Carrara a deadly hatred existed. The Venetians never forgave him for assisting Genoa, her rival in commerce, in the war of Chioggia. Other grievances also stung the pride of the Republic. On one occasion Carrara, desirous of penetrating the de- signs of the government of Venice, hired some ruffian gondoliers, who seizing several senators in the dead of night, conveyed them to Padua, where confession of their policy was wrung from them. They were then compelled to take a solemn oath that they would not reveal this adventure, and for many years it was a profound secret. In 1404, Padua submitted to the a profound secret. In 1404, Padua submitted to the Venetians, to whom the people had ever leaned. A century afterwards, the old city sustained another terrible siege during the war of the League of Cam- brai.

The doge Leonardo Loredano had sent his two sons with a guard of a hundred picked men to help in the defence of the city, and three hundred patricians were volunteers in the same service. The army of Maximilian amounted to a hundred thousand fighting men, comprising five hundred French knights amongst whom was the celebrated Bayard.

Maximilian was so chagrined that he rode off with two or three followers, not stopping till he was forty miles from Padua. His army raised the siege fifteen days afterwards.

Galileo filled one of the chairs during eighteen years. Venice acknowledged no degrees but those conferred here. The first botanic garden in Europe, a school of ana- tomy, and a school for practical agriculture, were connected with the university. A tower of one of Eccellino’s prisons was converted into an observatory, and bore the following inscription:—“ This tower which formerly led to the shades below, now under the auspices of the Venetians, shows the way to the stars.\" Petrarch resided long at Padua, and Arqua, where he lies buried, is only a few miles distant. We had but an hour or two to spend at Padua, so after our breakfast, we sallied forth to see as much as possible. We were very tired, and the streets were hot and dusty. No trace of Roman architecture was to be seen ; but, as Eustace observes, it is not wonderful that so little of the original city remains, but that so much is left after all the changes it has undergone.

An apostle of peace, he reconciled contending republics, and deadly enemies became friends by his persuasions. Crowds from all the neighbouring cities came to listen to him. He summoned a vast meeting on the banks of the Adige, near Verona, and there the assembled thousands, weared of faction and war, drank in his promise of universal peace. But alas! too much puffed up with pride, he aimed at abso- lute power and his fall was great. We were soon rushing past the beautiful moun- tains near Verona, and caught glimpses of the towers and churches of the old city. Then we had another glorious view of the blue Lago di Garda, and of Peschiera and of the glittering Alps beyond.

On his recovery the lady offered the chevalier two thousand five hundred ducats as ransom, fearing that her house and property would be the prize of the conquerors. Bayard then asked to the prize of the conquerors. Bayard then asked to bid adieu to her daughters and gave each a thousand ducats as a marriage portion. Turning again to their mother, he begged she would distribute the remaining five hundred among the poor nuns who had suffered in the siege.

Como often escaped the ravages which other Italian cities suffered from the inroads of barbarians; but after the cities of northern Italy had formed them- selves into republics, Milan waged war with Como, in order to force on her a bishop appointed by a rival pope. The citizens, cleaving to Guido, their lawful pastor, suffered during eight successive years the attacks of the Milanese. But Sismondi says, they were the bravest people in all Italy, and defended themselves with extraordinary success. During this war, which has been compared to the siege of Troy, they built a fleet on the lake of Lugano, and transporting it over land to Lago Maggiore, and transporting it over land to Lago Maggiore, took their enemies by surprise. In 1127, the Milanese, exasperated by their pertinacity, made one more grand effort to conquer this courageous people. By means of moveable towers and battering rams, a breach was made sufficiently large to admit cavalry. But Como had now lost nearly all her able bodied warriors. Few remained but old men, women and children. With marvellous dexterity they managed to divert the at- tention of the enemy during the night, when they embarked with their families and goods, and en- trenched themselves in a neighbouring fortress.

When Frederick Barbarossa entered Italy, Como took part with him, and then came the day of Milan’s retribu- tion. The high tower overlooking Como, is said to have been built by Frederick. In 1183 the town be- came free, but in 1246 it resigned its freedom to the Torriano family. From that time it shared the fate of Milan.

It was quite dark when we landed with two other travellers on the pebbly beach at Cadenabbia.

At one o'clock we dined, and just as we began to feel that a walk would be pleasant, a break in the clouds and a long line of blue sky tempted us to start for the villa Somma-riva. Chesnut and walnut- trees overhung the blue water. Narrow paths wound up the mountains that rise immediately from the lake. Lovely cottages, church spires, villas, and terraced gardens peeped from amid the rich foliage that coyers every hill. The sun was now shining brightly, the mountains were dressed in vivid green, the rain had given a freshened tint to the luxuriant foliage, and when the higher peaks broke away from the cultiva- tion they were bathed in an atmosphere that coloured them with celestial blue. We stopped before the gate of villa Somma-riva. A servant answered our summons, and we were con- ducted up a steep garden relieved by terraces. Here fuschias, myrtles, and verbenas grew into large trees, and covered the walls of the mansion. As we as- cended terrace after terrace, the view increased in beauty.

The inspectors of the road live in these dreary abodes, where refreshment can be obtained by travellers if necessary. We now turned to look at the ravine up which we had toiled. It is so contracted and the precipices are so high that it is in almost continual gloom. There appears no standing place amid these terrible crags.

Some workmen in the process of repairing a wall, had left several large blocks of stone strewn about the road. We had to dismount, and with considerable difficulty extracted the horses and the wheels. It was a wonder we were the horses and the wheels. It was a wonder we were not upset. The cheerful horn announced the near approach of another village. It is the last stage before Meran. Our dashing trot through the street must have disturbed some of the good folks, for all the houses seemed shut up for the night. “ Early to bed and early to rise, will make you both healthy, wealthy, and wise, —seems to be acted upon in Tyrol. How- ever, when we drew up before the inn, a girl came out, leaned over the balcony and held up a lantern to see the travellers. Then the landlord appeared, dived into an outhouse, and drew forth a venerable vehicle. Then we heard the reluctant steps of the horses coming from the stable, disappointed of their night’s rest. By the light of the lantern and the stars, the two men and the good-tempered girl quickly made ready for us, and away we went at full speed, soon leaving the dormant village far behind. Our recollections of this stage are dim and drowsy. One of the carriage-windows would not keep shut.

Chestnut, walnut, and apple trees in full fruit, and patches of Indian corn clothe steep ascent on either side. Sometimes we meet a hand- some lad with his pointed hat and leathern belt. He gives us a pleasant greeting as he drives his heavily laden mule. Now the friendly face of a comely woman wishes us well as she looks up from her cot- tage door, or helps to collect the walnuts which rain down upon the path as the children aloft shake them from the scented trees. Now a peasant with her basket of fruit, which is fastened to her back with broad leather straps, comes along, and for a small coin refreshes us all from her fragrant store. And now, as we still climb onwards, we hear at regular intervals a gentle murmur, and in another moment we meet a gentle murmur, and in another moment we meet three peasants. As they walk they pray. The father utters a petition first, and the mother and child re- spond; so they say their litany. A Tyrolese never shrinks from his religious duties through the fear of man—the bravest, the youngest, or the oldest, thinks it no shame to fall on his knees by the way-side chapel, whoever may be standing near. The cross is seen almost everywhere, along the loneliest paths and among the wildest rocks.

But the working man of Tyrol can meet his comrade under the hospitable roof the village gasthaus, and as he passes out can lift his hat with steady hand devout heart, not feeling that his conduct there and the emblem of his faith are incon- gruous. Ah! British workmen, with hearts as true and kind as any that beat for Tyrol, when will you cease to put yourselves in the power of that enemy who tyrannizes over you, and makes such cowards of you, that you vent your wrath oftentimes on women and trembling children—that subtle foe which makes you feel (for withal you are honest) that you could you feel (for withal you are honest) that you could not bear to see a holy picture, or a text of God’s word in that glaring ale-house! in that glaring ale-house!

Craggy mountains and glittering snow-peaks look down upon us all the while. We have to scramble as well as we can across the impe- tuous little streams that come bubbling and dancing down the rocks to join the Passeyr. As we gazed on this romantic valley, so shut in by the mountains, we did not wonder that its inhabitants fought so bravely in defence of fatherland, and that here a Hofer should be found ready to sacrifice his life for liberty. 5 Though poor the peasant’s hut, his feasts though small, He sees his little lot the lot of all. Cheerful at morn, he wakes from short repose, Breathes the keen air, and carols as he goes ; With patient angle trolls the finny deep, Or drives his venturous ploughshare to the steep At night returning, every labour sped, He sits him down the monarch of a shed; And even those ills that round his mansion rise, Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies. Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms, And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms; And as a child, when scaring sounds molest, Clings close and closer to the mother’s breast.

On arriving at the village of St. Martin, we were amused to find a little toll-gate across our grassy pathway. The houses here are all whitewashed, and have the brightest green Venetian shutters. Many are gaily decorated with religious pictures in fresco. It must not be supposed that the village-street has any pretence to regularity; wher- ever there is sufficient level ground for a house, there one has been built. Our path now took us among the newly mown hay, and brought us in full view of the mountains that close up the valley, and whose peaks we had seen all the morning. In a hollow near the base of one of these, lay the beautiful village of St. Leonhard, whose tapering spire and wide roofed cottages glistened in the sun. Before reaching it we stopped before a large picturesque house standing under a clump of trees close to the river. This was Am Sand—Hofer’s home. He was born here on the 22nd of November, 1767.

The broad Tyrolean hat and jacket, which the brave innkeeper wore when he was shot, hang in one of the tidy little bed-rooms. From the landing at the top of the staircase you can walk into a wide balcony outside the house, well furnished with seats and a table. Here Hofer doubtless often sat with his brave companions, concocting schemes for the deli- very of their country. It was impossible for the liberty-loving mountaineer to submit to the oppressive exactions of Bavaria. The Tyrolese had enjoyed a constitution of their own ever since the time of Mar- garet of Tyrol, in the fourteenth century. When she became too old to govern herself, she handed the country to her three cousins, one of whom was prince of Austria, making them swear to keep inviolate the privileges of her people. Eventually the whole of the Tyrol fell into the hands of Austria. She kept the oath and secured an ally at all times ready to honour and fight for her. We sat down and read the framed letter. “ It is the will of God that I should die at Montua,\" writes the patriot ; and then his mind wanders to the Pas- the patriot ; and then his mind wanders to the Pas- — seyrthal. He no longer sees his dungeon as he says- * Good bye beautiful world.“ He thinks of the snowy peaks and mighty forests, of the dear house by the road side, and of the sunny glades and pleasant the road side, and of the sunny glades and pleasant                               "

We remembered the splendid tomb erected at Inn- spruck to her grandfather’s memory, and of his being universally acknowledged as governor of Tyrol. Is he dishonoured by his daughter’s honest, toil? «The dignity of Labour!

The neces- sity for industry saves from the peculiar perils of the indolence which wealth permits. If it is denied the luxuries of leisure, it is spared its temptations too.

Those illumi- nated heights still shining so brilliantly, were telling the benighted earth that day was coming. But there is the stellwagen toiling up the steep street.

It soon gets broad daylight. The farther we go from the snowy heights of the Ortler, the larger it appears. New domes and vallies and glittering fields of snow come into sight. This mountain is more than 14,000 feet high. On our left we see the great monastery of Marienberg, standing alone on a bleak height. We are now passing the scene of a great victory by the Swiss over Maximilian in 1499. It was Austria’s last effort to regain Switzerland. The road is now level. We pass along the margin of two small lakes, and through one or two villages. They are very clean, but every thing seems bleached with the cold, and not even a pine-tree is to be seen.

Near this, the Austrians have a fort and the rock is pierced with loop-holes. 1 have attempted to describe several of the Tyrolese passes. Of this I shall only say that it surpasses in grandeur all the rest, and is a worthy rival of the Via Mala, on the Splugen. A few houses soon appear, and as we pass the small post-house we ask for letters. We were surprised in this remote region to be answered in very good English. We now arrived at Prutz, and felt we were on classic ground. We crossed a bridge over the foaming torrent. Up to this point the Tyrolese once allowed the enemy to advance. No sign of resistance met them. They heard no sound but the tumbling of the river below the road, until a the tumbling of the river below the road, until a mysterious voice shouted from some hidden spot, * Shall we begin?“ and the word “ No 2’ echoed down the pass. Onwards the enemy marched—the defile became narrower—there was only room for the torrent and the road between the mountains. And now a resolute voice was heard to cry—“ In the name of the Holy Trinity cut all loose!\" when rocks, stones, and trees rattled down the steep sides of the mountain into the very midst of the enemy, while the Tyrolese riflemen started from their hiding places, and helped to pour destruction the foe.

He fired and killed the first, with the butt-end of his weapon he beat down the second, then he grasped the third, he beat down the second, then he grasped the third, and leapt with him into the gulf, shouting—“ For God and Tyrol.' Our road continued to descend, the defile opened and we had a view of the cheerful and picturesque and we had a view of the cheerful and picturesque little town of Landeck. We changed coaches at the post-house, but had no time to explore the streets, or visit the church dedicated to “ Our lady of the darksome forest.\" Delightful letters from home awaited us. We were soon settled on the front seat of the diligence, and went bumping along the streets until a sudden turn brought us into the beautiful valley of the Sanna. 1 was not expecting so glorious a scene as that which was now before us. The road was excellent, and ascended gradually the wooded steeps. The torrent’s roar sounded less distinct as we climbed above it. The mountains became more precipitous, and the defile narrowed. Still we descried many cot- tages that nestled under the beetling crags, and many pleasant woodland-paths leading to them. A slight turn in the road brought us in sight of the view which is represented in the foregoing sketch.

The torrent mur- mured and fretted at being turned from its course by this extraordinary mountain. We could have lingered here long, but at the point of greatest beauty our road made a turn and we entered another valley. It commenced raining, and the grateful pine-trees gave forth a delicious fra- grance, the thick mosses under them wore a deeper shade of green, the ferns nodded in glee at the refreshing shower, while the more delicate flowers trembled and closed their petals from the heavy drops. As darkness increased we amused ourselves by singing some English songs. I am glad we did so, for it induced a pleasant voice from the coupé to say * encore \"’—and that led to a conversation which made us acquainted with a charming little lady from Botzen. She was on her way to Bregenz to visit her daughter who was at school there in a convent. It was now quite dark.

Besides ourselves the driver and the guard, there were three prim little girls and their mother; also a good-tempered woman, her husband children. who after a long sojourn in Botzen, were rejoicing in the prospect of returning to their native Switzer- the prospect of returning to their native Switzer- land ; there was the pleasant lady from Botzen, her maid, and the tutor of her boys; and also a lady and gentleman, with their nurse, and the baby whose piteous cries we had often heard from the inner com- partment. No wonder it cried, tied up as it was like à mummy, unable to move hand or foot ! It is the custom to bandage children in this manner until they are a year old. We were all up and ready for starting at five o’clock next morning. How cold it was travelling along in the gray light! The mountain-torrent ran level with our road. It was fed by many a sparkling rivulet, and the splash and murmur of their waters was very pleasant. The scene brightened, and “ Stars of morning, dew-drops which the sun Impearls on every leaf and every flower —\" sparkled on the mossy banks at the road-side.                              "

When a shepherd-boy, his heart was touched by compassion seeing the bodies of those who had perished exposed to view when the snow melted. He hoarded his wages, and collected alms, with which he founded and maintained his hospital. If we will have a heart and a hand ready to give, let us some- times visit for ourselves the homeless, the sick, and the destitute. Heinrich saw the ghastly face, the look of agony and helplessness, and needed no other exhortation to live a life of self-denial to diminish human suffering. About eight o’clock we stopped at a road-side inn where we found breakfast in readiness. As we sat table, the comely, good-looking mistress of the house stood behind us with her great jugs of hot coffee and milk, with which she replenished our large thick glass- cups. Warm and comforted, we again entered the diligence. We chatted with Madame, then read, then looked at scenery which here decreased in grandeur. We were leaving the mountains, and must soon bid farewell to beautiful Tyrol. At Bludenz we dined in a large bustling hotel, a great contrast to the primitive little inns we had been lately visiting. The landlady was a fashionably dressed young woman, who knew Madame, and was delighted to attend her. Four fresh horses pulled us to                              "

As we approached, we crossed a torrent which turns the wheels of several cotton-mills, and then joins the Rhine, which flows along only a mile or two from our road. We drive under some pre- cipitous cliffs, and have a fine view of the opening valley beyond. Numbers of villages spread over the plain. The mountains get lower, but they are the plain. The mountains get lower, but they are richly wooded. We are reduced to three horses now. We soon rattle over the stones in the little town of Dornbirn. Here Madame meets with more friends; all are glad to see her. How sunny and pleasant she is! We go sleepily along the level road, and the driver nods over his reins. We pass the convent where Madame’s daughter is at school. It is too late to see her this evening—a shade passes over the little mother’s face. Another mile or two is the little mother’s face. Another mile or two is traversed and we enter the clean and pretty town of Bregenz. We go to the hotel on the quay. The quiet lake spreads itself like a mirror before us. We get faint indications of distant mountains, but the shores of lake Constance are flat. And now the stars are peeping, and there is the beautiful comet shining over the clear water.

A Bregenz damsel was once living as a servant in Switzerland. She often sighed to see her home, and it happened that she visited it sooner than she anticipated. One evening a company of soldiers who were supping with her master, talked together of an intended attack on Bregenz. They spoke confidently of success, as the town was unsuspicious and unpre¬ pared. The girl slips away to the stable. The snow- white steed pricks his ears and neighs. She mounts him, and quietly leaves the yard. A touch of her heel, an encouraging chirrup—and the good horse bounds away—for Tyrol ho !—away like a flash of light through the quiet villages, and past the silent farms. With dilated nostril and eagerly stretched neck, the horse has caught the impatience of his rider, and her resolute will imparts strength to his bounding limbs. His deep steady breathing and the regular beat of his long stride are the only sounds in the silent night. But hark !—there is now the gurgling of the rushing Rhine. Start not, good horse ! One word from his rider keeps him steady. The bank is reached. Swerve not, good horse! The resolute little maid speaks again—and he plunges into the stream. Gallantly does he stem the strong cur- the stream. Gallantly does he stem the strong cur- rent, and invigorated by the cold water springs up the opposite bank. A little further still, brave steed ! the opposite bank. A little further still, brave steed !                              "

Madame invited us to her house at Botzen, and presented us with a us to her house at Botzen, and presented us with a basket of peaches. When we were on the steamer we saw our pleasant friends on the pier, waving a long adieu to us. We landed at Lindau, where we remained for an hour. The view from here of Bregenz and the dis- tant mountains, is very beautiful. We walked up one of the paved streets of Lindau, and admired the clean and picturesque white houses, many of them covered by the creeping vine. We left Lindau at one o’clock, and enjoyed the sail across the lake. Then we took the train and were soon rushing over rich, undulating plains, pass- ing lovely villages, and catching occasional and far ing lovely villages, and catching occasional and far off glimpses of snow-capped mountains.
