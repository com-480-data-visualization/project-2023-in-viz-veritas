            "PREFACE. CHE noble author of the following Letters was the only son and heir of Charles, the fourth earl of Orrery, by lady Elizabeth Cecil, daughter of John earl of Exeter. He was born January 2, 1706–7. Mr. Fenten, the author of Mariamne, and one of the coadjutors of Mr. Pope in the Odyssey, who had been secretary to lord Orrery in some of his campaigns in Flan¬ ders, and who, after being dismissed from that employment in 1705, had been mas¬ ter of the free school at Sevenoak in Kent, was again taken into the earls family as tutor to his sont. He taught lord Boyle * This may serve to disprove an assertion in Mr. Fenton’s lise in Biographia Britannica, that2“ the 66 carl of Orrery, after dismissing him in 1705, 6 paid him justly his salary as secretary, but * took no farther notice of him.33, See the Sup¬ plement to that work, p. 50. a to "

Soon after his coming of age, on May 9, 1728, lord Boyle married lady Henra¬ etta Hamilton, youngest daughter of George earl of Orkney. This marriage, though entirely approved by lord Orrery, was unhappily the source of a family, dissention between the two earis. A diffi¬ cult and delicate situation for a husband who was tenderly affectionate to a most deserving wise, and for a son who had the highest regard and attachment to his father! Such a father and such a son could not long be disunited. A recon¬ ciliation soon took place. “ They soon, as Mr. Budgell expresses it*, & ran into each otheris arms. 3 This happiness, however, was but tranfient; for the un¬ expected death of the earl of Orrery, which happened August 28, 1731, pre¬ vented his cancelling, as he had intend¬ 1 MIS.

All these debts, instead of suffering his fatheris effects to be sold, the son, with true filial piety and generosity, took upon himself, and fulfilled the bequests by paying the legacies, and sending the books, &c. within the limited time, to Christ-Church.

The family- seat Charleville having been burnt to the ground, by a x party of king James’s army, in 1699, he resided partly with a friend at that place, and partly at Corke. In that city he received another most severe shock, by he received another most severe shock, by the death of his countess, which hap¬ pened August 22, 1732. “ Though (as he observes) it pleased heaven after¬ he observes) it pleased heaven after¬ “ wards to repair the loss, in memory of this amiable lady the following cha¬ racter appears in his observations on Pliny †: If purest virtue, sense resin’d in vouth, Religious wisdom, and a love of truth, in asserting that:“ he did not take his seat as an in asserting that:“ he did not take his seat as an 2: Englisp baron till November 7, 1735,33 a mistake which has been copied in the Supplement to Bi¬ ographia Britannica, p. 16. * Lionel, the third earl of Orrery, was then a mi¬ nor, in England, and therefore could not have of¬ fended either party. 3 Thave seen the ruins of this 16 house,33 says our author,“ and could perceive, 2 by the few remains, that it had been a very e5 extensive pile of building. * B. viii.

This summer, probably in his way to France*, lord Orrery visited the tomb of his ancestors, Roger Boyle, Esq. and Joan his wise, in Preston church near Feverspam. This monument was erected to their me¬ mory by their second son, Richard, the great earl of Corke, in 1629; and his descendant, (when that title devolved to him) intended, if his lise had been pro¬ longed, to have reparred it. On this occasion, it may be observed, that the ancestors both of Swift and his biographer were, about the same time, two centuries ago, natives, or inhabitants, of the same city. The mother of the first earl of Corke (above mentioned) Joan, the daughter of Robert Naylor, Esque was born at Canterbyry in the year 1529, was married there tò Mr. Boyle (of Here¬ fordshire) in 1564, and their second son Richard was born there in 1566.

WHEN here, Lucinda, first we came, Where Arno rolls his silver stream, Hοw brisk the nymphs, the swains how gay! Content inspird eachirural lay: The birds in livelier concerts sung, The grapes in thicker clusters hung; All Ιοοkd as joy could never fail Among the sweets of ARNOS VALE. II. But now, since good Palemon died, The chief of shepherds and the pride. Old Arno’s sons must all give place To Northern swains, an iron race! The taste of pleasure now is o'er, Thy notes, Lucinda, charm no more, The Muses droop, the Goths prevail; Adieu the sweets of ARNOS VALE THEEND. "
