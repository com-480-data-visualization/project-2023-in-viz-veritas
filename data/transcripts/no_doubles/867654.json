            "PREFACE. HAT Egypt was to the antients, i Italy is to the moderns: a country abounding with many natural curi¬ osities, noble antiquities, and the richest pro¬ ductions of the arts and sciences. Architec¬ ture, sculpture, painting, and music, have ture, sculpture, painting, and music, have been carried here to their highest degree of perfection; so that pleasure and advantage arè mutually obtained by travelling in this coun¬ try, which has been so much celebrated by the Latin classies, that there is scarce any part the Latin classies, that there is scarce any part of it unnoticed in history; nor so much as a mountain or river that has not been the scene of some extraordinary action, and described by the most elegant poets. Italy, thus enriched by nature and adorned by art, is therefore by nature and adorned by art, is therefore justly esteemed the most agreeable and most useful part of Europe to a lover of antiquity, and the polite arts and sciences; nor is it and the polite arts and sciences; nor is it strange that it should be much frequented by foreigners of taste in this learned and refined age, or that many learned, curious, and in¬ genious gentlemen should have devoted their time in communicating the observations they made in such a land of curiosities, either to entertain and instruct their countrymen at home, or to direct them in their travels abroad.

            "PREFACE. WE may observe, among those who have written on Italy, that different authors have succeeded best on different sorts of curiosities; because sew men have abilities, advantages, or inclination for examining so copious a sub¬ ject; while some tread only in the steps of others, and repeat what was formerly written. Some travellers have been wholly taken up with antiquities, ruins, and inscriptions; others with buildings, statues, and pictures: some with geographical remarks and observations on the natural productions of the place; others the natural productions of the place; others on its religion and government: while another on its religion and government: while another sort make it their business to search into li¬ braries, collections of medals, and cabinets of rarities, for which Italy is remarkable. THE author of the following travels was an English gentleman, who undertook this an English gentleman, who undertook this tour of Italy, which he rightly considered as the finishing part of a polite education. He was accompanied by some other gentlemen, who had all the advantages of procuring access to the most valuable curiosities in public places and private palaces. Our author had a curi¬ osity equal to these advantages: he was not only a gentleman, but a scholar; a gallant of¬ ficer, and an experienced engineer; a good draughtsman, and a fine judge of paintings, sculpture, and architecture, which chiefly at¬ tracted his attention wherever he went. HE found many new subjects to employ himself upon; and he has handled them in a delicate manner. His remarks upon the best paintings "

            "PREFACE. paintings and sculptures are judicious and ani¬ mated, far above the common narratives and descriptions of other travellers: what he says, is purely his own, the object of his taste, and is purely his own, the object of his taste, and the result of his judgment: he depends upon no former authorities; he curiously sees what¬ ever he describes, and happily describes what¬ ever he sees. When he mentions things taken notice of by others, it is with conciseness and precision, avoiding stale informations and im¬ pertinent digressions. HE has considered things in a new light, and is particularly remarkable for the differ¬ ence of his tour from that of any other tra¬ veller, which is evident from the map an¬ nexed to this book. He sailed, on the 24th of January, 1752, O. S. from fort St. Philips, in the illand of Minorca, on board a ship in the illand of Minorca, on board a ship bound for Leghorn, distant from thence near 130 leagues. On the 26th, they were off the illand of Corsica; and the next day made the continent between St. Remo and Oneglia; but, as the wind was contrary, they bore away for Toulon, on the 29th passed through the isles of Hieres, and entered the bay of Toulon the 3oth. Here they performed a qua¬ on the 3oth. Here they performed a qua¬ rentine of ten days, and then salled for Leg¬ horn, where they arrived on the 7th of Fe¬ bruary. INSTEAD of making the tour of Italy in the manner generally done, our author took a new method in these travels. He first vi¬ a new method in these travels. He first vi¬ sited the principal places in Tuscany, and par¬ ticularly "
        ],
        [
            "PREFACE. ticularly the celebrated city of Florence; from whence he went to Rome; of which he only took a cursory view, and proceeded to Na¬ ples. He returned from thence to Rome to take a more particular survey of its curiosities; after which he set out for the famous town of Loretto, near the Adriatic; and departed from thence for Bologna. He then went to Ve¬ nice, Mantua, Parma, Reggio, and Modena, re-entered Tuscany, returned to Leghorn, and set out from thence by sea for Genoa. He went by sea from Genoa to Villa Franca; from whence he proceeded by land into France, and came to Marseilles, where these travels end. WHEREVER our author passes, he shews himself both a geographer and a scholar, by giving an exact and pleasing description of the present situation of the country, and entering into a comparison of it with what it was in former times, as described by the antients: this evident from his account of the differ¬ ent roads from one place to another; as also of the Pantheon, the Capitol, the Vatican; the pillars of Trajan and Antonine; the arches the pillars of Trajan and Antonine; the arches of Titus, Severus, and Constantine, in Rome; but more particularly so in his account and modern divisions of that capital, and of the Appian way, in which he has shewn an amaz¬ ing share of erudition; and also in his descrip¬ tion of Virgils tomb, Vesuvius, Herculane¬ um, and other places adjacent to Naples. He has disregarded useless inscriptions, and tedious epitaphs; "
        ],
        [
            "PREFACE. epitaphs: but what he has inserted are useful or elegant; as the epitaph on Giotto, Carelo Aretino, and Raphael; as also the account of Rome by Petrarch and Janus Vitalis; and the famous epigram on Venice, by Sannazarius. SOME opportunities have been taken to shew his knowledge in military discipline, and his skill in fortification; as in Florence and in In every state, he shews himself Naples. well acquainted with their different modes of government; but his principal taste was for the branches of architecture, sculpture, and painting; in which he has particularly excel¬ led all those who have yet written upon that subject. For this, it is sufficient to look at his account of the palaces in the city of Flo¬ rence, where he describes the Venus of Medi¬ cis in a masterly stile; as also his description of the churches and convents in Florence; the churches, convents, and palaces in and about Naples; the same in Rome, Venice, and other places, particularly the Laocoon at Rome, and the Hercules Farnese. WE have now selected only his remarks upon Italy, which might have afforded mate¬ rials for a much larger work: but the editor has comprised the whole in this single volume, for the benefit of the public, and the conve¬ nience of travellers.

NTIENT Italy extended no farther north than the river Arno, in Tuscany; and Athe river Rubicon, near Rimini. All be¬ vond was called Cisalpine Gaul, divided into Cispa¬ dana and Transpadana, which included the greatest dana and Transpadana, which included the greatest part of modern Italy. THE general name of Italy was probably derived from Etolia, a Grecian nation, opposite to this coun¬ try, from which it is separated only by the Adriatic gulph. The southern part was inhabited by various tribes, who communicated their names to the several subdivisions; as the Latins, Sabines, Tuscans, Sam¬ nites, Campani, Picentini, and Tarentini: but the whole country was antiently called Ausonia, Latium, Hesperia, Saturnia, and Oenotria. ACCORDINO to the earliest accounts we have, this extensive and beautiful peninsula was then in the same situation that it is now, cantoned out into va¬ rious little states and republics, all living in distrust, B or "

The Latins sub¬ dued the other tribes, and founded Rome about the year of the world 3300, and 704 years before the year of the world 3300, and 704 years before the birth of Christ. The regal line continued from Ro¬ mulus to Tarquin the Proud, who was deposed in the year of the world 3518, when the constitution the year of the world 3518, when the constitution was altered from a monarchy to a republic. THE Roman commonwealth changed the face of things, by swallowing up all, and making herself the head and mistress of Italy. Carthage was con¬ quered, and all Greece was reduced, by the Roman arms, which became invincibe. But Julius Caesar established a new monarchy, which continued till the reign of Constantine, who removed the seat of the empire from Rome to Constantinople. The empire was afterwards divided into two parts; the one called the Roman empire, whose monarch resided at Rome; and the other the Grecian empire, whose emperor had his residence at Constantinople; till the fifth cen¬ tury, when the Goths, Vandals, and other northern nations, broke into the Roman empire, and divided it among them. The north part of Italy fell to the share of the Lombards; while Ravenna and Naples were possessed by the Grecian emperors a considerable time after the destruction of the empire of Rome, of which Augustulus was the last sovereign, in the year of Christ 473 CHARLEMAGNE invaded Lombardy; took Didier, the last king, prisoner; and put an end to that king¬ dom, about the year 774: after which, he confirmed the exarchate of Ravenna to the pope, with other the exarchate of Ravenna to the pope, with other territories; and, in return, the pope crowned Charle¬ magne emperor of the Romans in 800, whereby a new empire was founded in the west, which compre¬ hended Germany, France, Italy, and part of Spain. As the emperors resided in Germany, the Italian governors assumed sovereign authority; by which means several principalities and states were erected; and the popes, at last, incited insurrections against the "

            "STATE OF ITALY, &c. 3 the emperors. Pope Gregory VII. excommunicated the emperor Henry IV. and deprived him of part of his prerogatives, which occasioned frequent wars, wherein some of the Italian princes and states pro¬ cured their independency to be established *. WE have different computations of the extent of Italy, according to the different notioris that antient and modern writers have entertained of the proper bounds of this country: however, let it suffice, that from the frontiers of Switzerland to the extremity of the kingdom of Naples, it is about 750 miles in of the kingdom of Naples, it is about 750 miles in length; and from the frontiers of the duchy of Sa¬ voy to those of the dominions of the state of Venice, which is its greatest breadth, about 400, though in some places it is scarce a fourth part so broad. IT is bounded by the Alps, which separate it from France, Switzerland, and Germany, towards the north and north-west; by the gulph of Venice, or north and north-west; by the gulph of Venice, or Adriatic sea, and the country of Trent, towards the east; by the Ionian sea, and streight of Messina, to¬ wards the south; and the Tuscan sea, towards the wards the south; and the Tuscan sea, towards the west. THE seas which encompass Italy on three sides are the Adriatic, the Ionian, and the Tuscan: but it the Adriatic, the Ionian, and the Tuscan: but it has also abundance of fine lakes, and many large rivers, particularly the Tiber, Po, Arno, Mincio, Adda, Adige, and Volturno. ITALY may be considered under three grand Divi¬ sions: I. Upper Italy, comprehending Lombardy, so as to include the principality of Piedmont; to which may be added the dukedom of Savoy, though on this side the Alps; the duchies of Montferrat, on this side the Alps; the duchies of Montferrat, Milan, Parma, Modena, and Mantua, with the re¬ publics of Genoa and Venice.

THE principal Italian Islands are Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica: but there are also the Lipari illands, and Corsica: but there are also the Lipari illands, between Sicily and Naples; the illands of Caprea, Ischia, and others, in the gulph of Naples; as like¬ vwise the illands of Elba, and others, on the coast of Tuscany. ITALY extends from 38 degrees 20 minutes to 47 degrees of north latitude, and from the 7th to the 19th degree of east longitude; therefore the air of this country must be very different, according to the dif¬ ferent situations of the several countries of which it is composed. The northern parts, that lie upon the Alps, are cold, and covered with snow in winter: the hills of the Apennine, which run almost the whole length of Italy, are also cold: but the coun¬ tries on the north of the Apennine are temperate; and those on the south are warm. The Campania of Rome is unhealthy, and so is the Ferrarese, occa¬ sioned by bogs and stagnant waters. In other parts the air is generally pure and dry; and though Na¬ ples, from its southern situation, might be thought the hottest; yet, being almost surrounded by the sea, it is continually refreshed by breezes from thence. As Italy hath been thus bountifully supplied by nature, it has farther, from the ingenuity and appli¬ cation of its inhabitants, been esteemed the mother of arts and commerce in respect to the rest of Eu¬ of arts and commerce in respect to the rest of Eu¬ rope. Its reputation is still so high with regard to the first, that the tour of Italy is considered as the necessary conclusion of a polite education, and in reference to the latter, the ports of Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, and Venice, without mentioning those in Sicily, make still a very great figure, and derive vast advantages to the sovereigns in whose dominions they are situated.

Of the declension of the ARTS and SCIENCES; and their revival in ITALY. WHEN Rome had extended her empire into Asia, Africa, and almost over all Europe, she saw her ci¬ tizens arrive at the summit of human glory; but the Romans, in their pretensions to science, gave place to the Greeks, whom they revered as their masters in the school of arts. IT seems as if there were certain periods of time, in which a spirit of perfection universally diffuses it¬ self in the same country throughout all professions, without its being possible to assign how or why it should happen so. Yet we may assert, that all arts and sciences are allied in some manner to each other; and that the taste of perfection is the same in what¬ ever depends upon genius. If cultivation be want¬ ing, an infinity of talents lie buried; but when true taste awakes, those talents derive mutual aid from each other, and shine out in a particular manner. The misfortune is, that this perfection itself, when arrived at its supreme degree, is the forerunner of the decline of arts and sciences, which are never nearer their ruin than when they appear the most re¬ mote from it. Such are the instability and vicissitude of all human things. * The curious reader may compare this account with the state of Italy, as given by Machiavel to Pope Clement VII.

THE Goths and Vandals took advantage of the last strugglings of the Roman state; and Odoacer, king of the Heruli, with an innumerable multitude of the barbarous nations, ravaging Italy, approached to Rome, which he entered without any resistance, deposed the emperor Augustulus, and secured the imperial dignity to himself, which was soon trans¬ ferred to Theodoric the Goth. In this manner the inundations of the barbarous people proved equally fatal to arts and empire; and Rome herself, when she ceased to be the mistress of the world, in a little time quite forgot to speak the Latin tongue* THE fine arts are like the fabled phenix, they revive out of their own ashes; therefore we have reason to believe that some of those arts were several times ex¬ tinguished, and renewed again, in the first ages. As the fine arts were extinct in Italy ever since the erup¬ the fine arts were extinct in Italy ever since the erup¬ tion of the barbarians, the senate of Florence sent for painters out of Greece, to restore painting in Tuscany. The famous Cimabue was their first disciple, and made such a progress in this art, that when Charles of Naples passed through Florence he visited Ci¬ mabue, and thought himself very well entertained by the sight of his works. This was about the year the sight of his works. This was about the year 1280, at which time painting in oil was unknown. PAINTING, as well as other arts, came to be known by the progress it made in the minds of men. Those that began to revive it in Italy, and consequently had but weak principles to go by, drew the admiration of the spectators by the novelty of their works: but of the spectators by the novelty of their works: but as the number of painters increased, and emulation as the number of painters increased, and emulation gave them new lights in their art, so the beauty and value of their pieces increased; from whence arose Rollin’s history of the arts and sciences of the antients, part iii¬ Kennett’s Romae antiquae notitia, part i. p. 28.

Aτ last, after several years, the good genius of painting raised up some great men in Tuscany, and the duchy of Urbin, who by the goodness of their the duchy of Urbin, who by the goodness of their talent, the solidity of their understanding, and the assiduity of their studies, elevated the ideas of the knowledge which they learnt of their masters, and produced some things so perfect, that they will al¬ ways be the admiration of posterity: but those to whom we are principally indebted for this perfection are Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, and Ra¬ phael. III. Of TASTE in PAINTINO. THE different tastes of nations may be reduced to six; the Roman, Venetian, Lombard, German, Fle¬ mish, and French. 1. THE Roman taste is an idea of the works that are to be met with in Rome, where the most valu¬ able pieces are those called antiques, and the modern productions made in imitation of them, whether in sculpture or painting. The excellence of these pieces consists chiessy in the beauties of design, the fine choice of the attitudes, the delicacy of expression, fair order of the foldings, and a sublime stile to which the antients raised nature, and after them the moderns in the beginning of the sixteenth century. 2. The Venetian taste is quite different from the Roman; for as the latter neglected colouring too much, the former did the same by design; there being few antiques at Venice, and few pieces of sculpture or painting in the Roman taste.

They characterised them by comparison, not only by shewing the value of the true colour of one thing by the true colour of another, but by choosing in this opposition an harmonious vigor of co¬ louring, and every thing that might render their ob¬ jects the more probable and surprising. 3. THE Lombard taste consists in a flowing mel¬ low design, where a fine choice of nature is some¬ what mingled with the antique, in colours nearly ap¬ proaching those of lise, and laid on with a flight pencil. 4. THE German taste is commonly called the Go¬ thic gout, which is an idea of nature as we see her generally with her defects, and not as she might be in her purity. 5. THE Flemish taste differs only from the Ger¬ man in a greater union of well chosen colours, an excellent claro obscuro, and a mellower pencil. 6.

CHE duchy of Tuscany, knovn antiently by the names of Ombria, Tyrrhenia, and He¬ truria, fell under the dominion of the Ro¬ mans, about 455 years before Christ. The Ostro¬ goths possessed it in the fifth century, and then the Lombards, who were expelled by Charlemagne in the year 800; after which it became subject to the German emperors, who appointed the governor, un¬ til the pope encouraged these governors to render themselves independent, and accept of his protection against the emperor: but the government was at last invested in the house of Medicis. TUSCANY is now composed of the territories that formerly belonged to the then distinct republics of Florence, Sienna, and Pisa. The bounds which are generally ascribed to Tuscany are the river Tiber, the Apennine mountains, and the river Magra; so the Apennine mountains, and the river Magra; so that it is surrounded by the popes territories on the north, east, and south- east; by the Tuscan sea on the south west; and by the territories of Genoa and the south west; and by the territories of Genoa and Modena "

With re¬ spect to strength and convenience, it has all the ad¬ vantages from situation that can be wished. As to the soil, it is in some parts mountainous, where there are mines of copper, iron, silver, and alum, with quarries of fine marble, alabaster, and por¬ phyry. In other parts it abounds with pleasant hills, which are covered with vines, oranges, lemons, olives, and other fruits: but in some places there are vallies which produce abundance of corn and grass. It has many little rivers; but the chief of them is the Arno. The other commodities besides those already mentioned, are wool, flax, saffron, serges, woollen cloths, silks, tapestries, gilt leather, carthen ware, and perfumes. THERE is no country in the world where the people seem better adapted to mercantile affairs, or where they know better how to make that dispo¬ sition turn more to account. All the princes of the house of Medicis were themselves merchants, the house of Medicis were themselves merchants, and by their example commerce has been always thought there a thing not at all incompatible with nobility. FLORENCE shared the unhappy fate of its neigh¬ bouring states, by the factions of Guelphs and Gi¬ belines: but, about the year 1419, Cosmo de Me¬ dicis, lord of Florence, whose family had been long powerful, won the hearts of the people by his ge¬ nerosity: they called him their Father, and the De¬ liverer of his Country. He adorned the city with many stately buildings, and enjoved the highest ho¬ nours to his death in 1464.

POGGIO Imperiale.–This villa is an Italian mile, or a thousand paces, out of the city, in a direct line from the Porta Romana. It was called Poggio, or Villa Imperiale, from Margaret of Austria, who married the grand duke Cosmo II. and built this palace. There is a stately avenue leading to it, con¬ sisting of a double row of cypress and larch trees, with beautiful vinevards, convents, and villas, on each side. Near a fine piece of water, here are two very large statues of the rivers Arno and Arbia, pouring water out of their urns; and opposite to those are the statues of Homer, Virgil, Dante, and Petrarch. Fronting the palace is a large amphi¬ theatre, with cypress-trees, and a stone ballustrade. D ODV On one side of the cliuance is a large marble natue ef "

HORSE and Chariot Race. —On every 24th of June they have a horse and chariot race in this city, in imitation of the antients, and as a festivity in honour of St. John the Baptist, the tutelar saint of Florence. It is exhibited in the square or piazza del Granda Duca, which is surrounded with guards to keep out the mob. The horses start without ri¬ ders, and run full two miles through the streets, from the gate called Porta del Prato that called Porta Santa Croce. The streets are covered with iand on this occasion; and the horses have a round machine, something like a ball, hanging down their sides by strings, with small iron pricks in it as sharp as the point of a lancet; so that the faster they run as the point of a lancet; so that the faster they run the more they spur themselves.

THE Carnival. –This a time of great diversion among the Florentines, who are then generally masked, and assemble in the afternoon in the square of Santo Croce, which is railed in, sometimes to the number of ten thousand masks and upwards, richly dressed in all kinds of character: but no priest dares to be present at these diversions in mask, for fear of the inquisition.

While these diversions pass within¬ side the rails, others are going forward without-side them, either in coaches or cars, some of which are full of musicians, who sit on benches, as in our or¬ chestra, dressed in the most whimsical grotesque manner, and play a variety of tunes on different instruments. The drivers, and even their horses, are all in masquerade; so that it is impossible to conceive the gaiety of this carnival, which continues about three weeks or a month: but Sundays are the greatest days for these diversions, which end when Lent begins.

When Bernini first observed this, he sarcastically asked, from whence came that wind. Mochi an¬ swered, “ From the crack you made in the cupola. At the discovery of which Bernini was obliged to quit Rome for some time. It was occasioned by his making a staircase in one of the supports of the cu¬ pola; and all means are still tried to close this crack, but to non purpose, for it continually enlarges, which must in time be of fatal consequence to this noble church. THE pavement of the church is all of fine marble beautifully inlaid; and a great part of the buildine is incrusted with marble, to which they are daily adding some ornaments. Here are several fine mo numents of the popes, and that of Alexander VII. has a grand design at the bottom, of death forcing through a curtain. The monument of Christina, queen of Sweden, is adorned with curious sculp¬ ture, and there is her picture in a great medal of brass, which is perfectly well executed; but her body is deposited within a plain tomb under the church. The mausoleum of the countess Matilda is very magnificent, on which is her statue of white marble, beautifully done. None can be interred in St. Pe¬ ter’s church, except the successors of that apostle; but the popes permitted these two princesses to be buried there, who were of such high birth, and had done so much for the church, that they well deserved to be honoured with this distinction: for Matilda defended the church, at the head of her army, against the emperor Henry IV. and Christina even abdicated her crown, and abandoned her dominions to embrace her crown, and abandoned her dominions to embrace the "

THERE are in this church twenty six chapels dedi¬ cated to different saints. In that called Clementina lies the body of St. Gregory the Great, and in another St. Chrysostom.

IN the sacristy, or vestry, are preserved the most valuable relics, richly cased in gold and silver orna¬ ments; the church-plate, and other sacred utensils, in solid gold, enriched with diamonds and other precious stones, as chalices, candlestics, crucifixes, shrines, and sacerdotal vestments, almost inestimable. THE expence of seeing the subterranean curiosities in the vaults does not exceed three paoli, or 15. 6d. sterling; and a man walks before with a lighted torch all the way. THOUGH every thing in this church is admirable, the most astonishing part of it is the cupola, which the most astonishing part of it is the cupola, which is all wrought in mosaic.

OF 139 THIS son-in-lav to Augustus Caesar dedicated this edifice either to Jupiter Ultor the Avenger I, or to Mars and Venus, or more probably to all the gods to Mars and Venus, or more probably to all the gods in general, as the very name implies. But pope Bo¬ niface IV. in 607, consecrated this temple to the true god, by dedicating it to the holy virgin and the christian martyrs, with the title of Sta. Maria ad the christian martyrs, with the title of Sta. Maria ad Martyres: and pope Urban VIII. adorned it with two towers in 1632, as appears by a Latin inscrip¬ tion over the door within the edifice. However, this church is so much changed from the ancient Pantheon, as Pliny has described it, that some have been inclined to think it was not the same temple; but the cavalier Fontana has abundantly satisfied the world in this particular, and fhewn how the ancient figure and ornaments of the Pantheon have been changed into what they are at present.

The light comes in only at a circular opening over the center, on the top, which disperses beautifully on the objects on the top, which disperses beautifully on the objects below; and this aperture is about nine feet in dia¬ meter. The pavement is made of large square stones and porphyry, sloping all round tovards the center, where the rain-water falling down through the aper¬ ture is conveved away by a proper drain, covered with a stone full of holes. EIGHT fine altars are placed round this church, at which are tyo extraordinary porphyry pillars, and fourteen of giallo and granito, above nine feet round. At one of these altars, dedicated to the virgin Mary, is the monument of the great Raphael Urbin; and near it is that of Annibal Caracci.

THE Vatican. —Mons Vaticanus owes its name to the ansvers of the Vates, or prophets, that used to be given here; or from the god Vaticanus, or Va¬ gitanus; but it seems not to have been inclosed within the walls till the time of Aurelian. This hill vas formerly famous for the sepulchre of Scipio Afri¬ canus, some remains of which are still to be seen; but it is more celebrated at present on the account of St. Peter’s church, the popes palace, and the noblest library in the world. THE Vatican is a palace belonging to the pope, extremely irregular, very high, vastly great, and so close to St. PeterS that it gives a bad effect to the vieving "

Here are painted the chief works of Sixtus V. and the histories of sixteen councils: and to set in view the origin of learning in several countries, there are painted on large pilasters ranged among the middle of the library, those per¬ sons who were reputed to have been the inventors of letters in distant languages; Adam, Abraham, Moses, Mercurius, Aegyptius, Hercules, Cadmus, Cecrops, Pythagoras, and others, with letters, which "

At this time nothing was more usual than to have the greatest actions of the heroes they stood to honor the greatest actions of the heroes they stood to honor curiously expressed, or the whole procession of the triumph elegantly sculptured on the sides. THE arches built by Romulus were only of brick, and that of Camillus of plain square stone; but those of Caesar, Drusus, Titus, Trajan, Gordian, and others, were all entirely of marble. As to their figure, they were at first semicircular, whence probably they took their names. Afterwards they were built four-square, with a spacious arched gate in the middle, and little ones on each side. Upon the vaulted part of the middle gate hung little winged images, representing Victory, with crowns in their hands, which, when they were let down, they put upon the heads of the conquerors, as they passed under in triumph*. The principal triumphal arches, which now remain, are those of Titus, Septimius Se¬ verus, and Constantine, the last of which is the most magnificent and best preserved. TITUS'S Arch. –In the way over the Campus Vac¬ cinus to the Capitol stands the triumphal arch of Titus, which is a single arch in good condition, and has a Latin inscription, importing, that“ the senate and people of Rome erected this arch to the emperor Titus, son of Vespasian. It was erected to cele¬ brate his triumph over the Jews, after he had de¬ stroyed Jerusalem.

CONSTANTINEIS Arch. –The triumphal arch of Constantine the Great stands in the Via Appia, at the junction of the Celian and Palatine mounts the junction of the Celian and Palatine mounts Under the main arch are two Latin inscriptions; that on one side signifies, “ To the deliverer of the city; on one side signifies, “ To the deliverer of the city; and that on the other side, 6 To the author of the public tranquility.2 On both sides the architrave is a Latin inscription, importing, that6“ the senate and a Latin inscription, importing, that6“ the senate and people of Rome dedicated this triumphal arch to the emperor Constantine, because through à divine im¬ pulse, with a greatness of mind, and by force of arms, he delivered the commonwealth at once from the tyrant and all his faction. THIS arch is well kept up, though the architectur of it is very indifferent. There was once on the top of this arch a triumphal chariot, drawn by eight horses of gilt metal, taken from the arch of Trajan. which was carried off by the plundering Goths. An admirable long basso-relievo, which was entire, and represented Trajan’s victory over the Dacians, was cut into four parts, to adorn this of Constantine.

IT is very probable, both from the present ruins and passages of ancient writers, that in most places the walls of the modern city were the limits of the ancient, and that the entire circumference of both was nearly equal: but there is a great difference in the number of buildings on the same ground-plot; the number of buildings on the same ground-plot; for the plan of modern Rome plainly shews that one half of it is not built upon, and that those places on which the most splendid and magnificent struc¬ tures "

WHAT high ideas Petrarch entertained of the grandeur of ancient Rome appear from the fol¬ lowing beautiful lines of that celebrated poet: Qui fu quella di imperio antica sede, Temuta in pace triomfante in guerra. Fu! perchaltro che il loco hor non si vede; Quella che Roma fu giace, s’atterra.

E tra queste ruine a terra sparte, In se stessa cadea morta e sepolta. following is a new translation of the above P: THE 66 The ancient seat of empire here we trace, In war victorious, dreaded evn in peace. Alas! this site is all that now we know, And what was Rome her ruins only show. Those lofty structures, which to heavn aspir d, Are levelled with the earth, no more admir’d: The glory of the world rude time devours, Which humble plams exalts, and throws down mighty towrs. Rome is no more! destroyd by fire and sword, Her grandeur in her ashes is deplor’d: In scatter d fragments lie, in evry part, The noblest works of nature and of art. The glorious ruins her sepulchre frame; A monument of her extinguishd fame. WE may conclude this subject with the folloving ingenious epigram of Janus Vitalis, another Italian poet: Quid Romam in media quaeris novus advena Roma, Et Romae in Roma nil reperis media? Aspice murorum moles, praeruptaque saxa, Obrutaque horrenti vasta theatra situ. * It is generally observed, that modern Rome stands higher than the ancient; some have computed it about fourteen or fifteen feet, taking one place with another. The reason given for it is, that the present city stands upon the ruins of the former. Addison, p. 175 4 There is a poor translation of the same lines in Keysser, vol. ii. p. 7. Haec "

CHE kingdom of Naples is the south-east part of Italy, bounded by the Adriatic sea I on the north- east, by the Ionian sea on the south- east, by the Tuscan sea on the south-west, and south- east, by the Tuscan sea on the south-west, and by the popes dominions on the north-west. The extent is 240 miles in length from the north-west to the south-east; 160 in breadth where broadest, and 80 in the narrowest part. It is usually divided into four large provinces, called Terra di Lavora, Ab¬ ruzzo, Apulia, and Calabria †. THE revenues of the crown amount to about a million sterling yearly, arising from a composition of the nobility and gentry for certain sums, in lieu of their personal services, from a duty on houses, and almost a general excise. The crown claims a power of taxing the nobility and gentry, and raising what forces the court thinks necessary; but the clergy are not taxed, as they grant a free-gist, which is pro¬ portionable to the taxes of the laity at least. † It contains the old Samnium, Campania, Apulia, Lucania, and Brutium, witha little of Latium.

THE dignified clergy and nobility of this kingdom are so numerous as to be computed at twenty-five archbishops, 125 bishops, 300 princes, dukes, mar¬ quisses, and earls. The clergy possess one third of the kingdom; the crown, the nobility, and gentry, the rest: but the peasants have scarce any thing they the rest: but the peasants have scarce any thing they can call their own, being subjects and vassals to therr respective lords, who are like sovereigns wherever they are proprietors of the soil¬ As the nobility and gentry hold their lands by military tenures, they have a numerous militia; but these are seldom called out, for the king usually maintains 15, 000 regular troops in time of peace and can raise more than double that number in time of war. THE king has a fleet of armed gallies, and a fev men of war, but unworthy the name of a fleet. THIS country abounds with all kinds of grain fruit, herbage, flax, and wine in the highest per¬ fection. It also produces alum, vitriol, sulphur, rock-chrystal, marble, and several sorts of minerals. The wool is excellent, both for strength and fineness Silk is produced in such plenty, that vast quantities ob it are annually exported. Here are to be seen some of the finest herds and flocks in the werid; and Neapolitan horses are highly esteemed throughout all Europe. Calabria is famous for its manna, and produces good saffron, which grows also in other parts of the kingdom. THOUGH they abound in silk, that manufacture is not great, as they send most of it abroad unwrought. Besides, all the merchandize of this rich soll is carried abroad in foreign shipping, because they have fev merchants or ships of their own, the proprietors of the lands selling the produce of their respective the lands selling the produce of their respective estates to foreigners.

            "THE KINGDOM or NAPLES. 181 BEFORE the establishiment of the Roman republic in Italy, that part of it now called Naples consisted of many independent towns, principally inhabited by Grecian colonies, which were all gradually sub¬ dued by the Romans: and the Carthaginians, who had made some settlements there, being afterwards expelled Sicily, that illand was also subdued, and became a Roman province. But, on the decline of that empire, in the fifth century, the eastern emperor possessed himself of one part of Naples, and the Goths of the other. The Lombards dispossessed the Goths of their part, and remained masters of it until they were expelled by Charlemagne, about the year 806. The Saracens subdued a great part of Naples in the ninth and tenth centuries; but they were driven out again by the pope, with the as¬ fistance of other christian powers; in which service Tancred the Norman, and his twelve sons, had so principal a share, that great part of this king¬ dom was given them by the pope. Robert, the son of Tancred, was created duke of Apulia and Ca¬ of Tancred, was created duke of Apulia and Ca¬ labria, by the German emperor; and Roger, the son of Robert, was made king of the Two Sicilies, comprifing Naples and Sicily. The heirs of Tancred enjoved this crown to the year 1166, when they disobliged the pope, who introduced the earl of Anjou and the French, and his posterity were kings of Naples and Sicily until they were dispossessed by the Spaniards in 1504 4.

UPON the breaking out of the war, on account of the Polish election in 1733, France, Spain, and Sar¬ dinia, united against the emperor, which entirel changed the face of affairs in Italy. The king of Spain had obtained all he could pretend to in right of his queen, and began to revive the claims which he renounced in right of his crown. While the French and Piedmontese attacked the Imperialists in the Milanese, the infant Don Carlos, the king of Spains the Milanese, the infant Don Carlos, the king of Spains second son 1, in March 1734, penetrated through the Ecclesiastical dominions with a Spanish army, commanded under him by the count de Montemar, and arrived on the frontiers of the kingdom of Naples.

The new king constituted the duke de Montemar viceroy of Sicily, who soon conquered that illand; and Don Carlos was crowned at Palermo, as he had been at Naples where he afterwards kept his residence.

Fondi is a poor tovn. in a marshy, unwholesome situation; but as the Appian Way goes all along it, care is taken to keep the streets of the town well paved. It was burnt by the famous Barbarossa, who ransacked the place, and carried away the principal inhabitants as slaves to Algiers.

The ruins of a palace are to be seen in this neighbourhood, which is said to have belonged to Cicero, who was murdered as he went from hence by Popilius Laena. The port be¬ tween Formiae and Cajeta has been always understood for that into which Homer brings Ulysses and his friends, where they were affrighted with the gi¬ gantic Laestrygons †. OPPOSITE Mola lies the town of Gaeta, the fortress of which is about three miles from Mola, and by water is an hour’s passage; so that many travellers go over the gulph to visit that place, which was for¬ merly called Cajeta, who, as Virgil tells us, died and was buried here T.

CHE churches and convents of Naples are ex¬ cessively rich and fine, for the profusion of I marble to be seen in them is scarcely to be imagined; but the disposition of it in the incrustations is not so judicious as in the churches of Rome. CHURCHES.––1. The duomo, or cathedral, is a fine ancient building, dedicated to St. Januarius; and in one of the chapels is the tomb of that saint, who was bishop of Benevento, and is called the pro¬ tector patron of this city. They say he was murdered, and that some of his blood is preserved in a glass vial. They also pretend to have his head inclosed in a silver case, exactly resembling the head; and, when put near the vial, the concreted blooc soon liquifies. THE dome is exceedingly rich in all sorts of or¬ naments of sculpture, painting, and gilding, as well as marble. The cupola is painted by Lanfranc, and The town in soft solemnities delights, And gentle poets to her arms invites: The people, free from cares, serene and gay, Pass all their mild, untroubled hours away, Addison, p. 130.

The same is done in the chapel of St. Januarius; and the altar¬ pieces under the angles, and over the great altar of the chapel, are entirely by Dominichino, which are esteemed fine. The steps up the ascent to the high altar are of white marble, and adorned on the sides with curious basso-relievos. Fronting the altar are two pillars of red jasper, twelve feet high. without the pedestals, which are of verde antico. On the right hand, near the high altar, is another beautiful altar, of Florentine work, and its tabernacle is set with the finest gems. Other parts of the church are painted by Lucca Jordano; with a great number of beautiful figures of profuse invention. THE foundation of this church was laid by Charles I. king of Naples, to whom a monument is erected near the great door. There is also the monument of Andrew, king of Naples, who was strangled by of Andrew, king of Naples, who was strangled by the intrigues of his queen Joanna, in 1345, when he vas but nineteen years of age. 2. GIEUSU NUOVO, or House of the Jesuits, has the most splendid church of all those belonging to that order in Italy, and is full of rich and magni¬ ficent ornaments. It is 250 palms long, and 200 broad, supported by six pilasters of a prodigious size, and incrusted with porphyry and other beautiful marble. The ceiling of the nave is painted by Ca¬ valier Massino and Bellisario. The cupola was painted by Lanfranc, and was the largest in all Naples, but vas almost all destroyed by an earthquake in 1688'; however, the angles are preserved, where the four evangelists are represented.

The Trinity chapel has a picture by Guercino, with some in fresco by Bellisario 1†. THE House is proportionably spacious, commo¬ dious, and richly adorned in every part. The gardens are extremely pleasant, and full of fountains. The infirmary and laboratory are grand, and furnished with all manner of necessaries. The library is well supplied; but there are sew manuscripts, and those chiefly in the Chinese language. 3. S. Maria Nuovo has a ceiling adorned vith such fine pantings and gilding, that it passes for one of the most beautiful churches in Naples. The pantings are by L.

His tomb is at the bottom of the choir, and made of very beauti¬ ful white marble. On the top of it is the busto of this great poet, crowned with laurel, between two little angels, with these words under it, ACTIUS SIN¬ CERUS. In the middle of the monument is an ad¬ mirable basso-relievo, where Neptune is represented with two satyrs, and two nymphs; which allude to his piscatory eclogues, his satyrical epigrams, and his Arcadia. On each side are seated two large statues, the one representing Apollo, and the other Minerva; but offence having been taken at the in¬ troducing of pagan deities into churches, and the removal of these exquisite pieces being apprehended, they were preserved by the artifice of making them pass for the images of David and Judith. The whole is the workmanship of Girolamo Santo Croce, à Nea¬ politan, who died before the finishing hand was put to the statues, which was done by Poggibonzo, of Tuscany, who was a Servite monk.

It abounds with rich ornaments in gold, silver, and marble. The pavement is very beautiful; and the cieling of the nave is of stucco work, painted by Lanfranc, who also drew the crucifixion, and the twelve apostles, in the front of the choir.

From hence are to be seen what was called the Mare Mortuum, or dead sea †; and the Elysian Fields, which are very un¬ worthy of that name. FARTHER on appears the isle of Isca; and on the lest is the Piscina Mirabilis, which is a large building almost under ground. The descent is by forty steps, some of which are in a ruinous condition.

It is thought to have been a reservoir for fresh water when the Roman fleets har¬ bored in these ports. Some attribute it to Lucullus, who had a superb palace in this neighbourhood; and others are of opinion, that it was made by Agrippa, for the conveniency of the Miseno fleet.

THE extremity of cape Miseno has a long clest in it, which was enlarged and cut into shape by Agrippa, who made this the great port for the Roman fleet that served in the Mediterranean; as that of Ravenna that served in the Mediterranean; as that of Ravenna held the hips designed for the Adriatic and Archi¬ pelago. The highest end of this promontory rises in the fashion of a monument or sepulchre to those that survey it from the land, which, perhaps, might occasion Virgil’s burying Misenus under it. The remains of a pharos, or light-house, are still to be seen on this promontory: but the most considerable antiquity of the place is a set of galleries hewn into the rock. Some will have them to have been a re¬ the rock. Some will have them to have been a re¬ servoir of water; but others more probably suppose them to have been Nero’s baths †. OPPOSITE to Miseno are the illands of Procita and Ischia, both of which produce plenty of fruit, and excellent wine, with pleasant spots for hunting.

They had for several preceding days together felt an earthquake, which being com¬ mon in Campania did not much alarm them; but the shocks were so violent that particular night, that all things around were not only moved but seemed upon the brink of destruction.

A little gleam of light then appeared. It was not day-light, but the fore¬ warning of the approach of some fiery vapor; which, however, discharged itself at a distance from them. Darkness immediately succeeded. Then ashes poured down upon them in large quantities, and heavy, which obliged them frequently to rise and brush them off, otherwise they had been smothered, or pressed to death by their weight. Pliny fortified himself with one great consolation, a miserable one indeed, that all nature was perishing with him. At last the darkness, drawn into the thinness of a cloud, or of smoke, went off; true day appeared; the sun shone forth, but pale as at the time of an eclipse. All objects that offered themselves to their sight, which was yet so weak that they could scarce bear the return of light, were changed and covered with ashes as thick as snow. At their return to Misenum, after having refreshed themselves, they remained in that suspence and doubt of mind which hope and fear inspire. Fear indeed was more prevalent, for the earthquake still continued, and several enthu¬ siasts, by dreadful prophecies, increased their ovn fears and the fears of others. But the younger Pliny fears and the fears of others.

To all this account the noble translator of Pliny the younger adds, that, in the vear 1717, doctor the younger adds, that, in the vear 1717, doctor Berkeley, afterwards bishop of Cloyne in Ireland, visited Vesuvius, at least with as much boldness and curiosity as Pliny the elder. The account given by the bishop of that mountain was communicated to the royal society by doctor Arbuthnot, and is pub¬ lished in the philosophical transactions. It agrees in many particulars with Plinys description; but his lordhip was inclined to believe, that the pumice¬ stones mentioned by Pliny were a kind of glutinous matter, which was thus described by the bishop. 6 THE other mouth was lower in the fide of the same new-formed hill. Icould discern it to be filled vith red-hot liquid matter, like that in the furnace of a glass-house; which raged and wrought as the waves in the sea, causing a short abrupt noise, like vhat may be imagined to proceed from a sea of quicksilver, dashing among uneven rocks. This stuff would sometimes spew over, and run down the con¬ vex side of the conical hill, and appeared at first red-hot: it changed color and hardened as it cooled, sheving the first rudiments of an eruption, or, if I may so say, an eruption in miniature. THE bishop further tells us his own safety was owing, in a great measure, to the favorable dispo¬ sition of the wind. His words are,“ Had the wind driven in our face, we had been in no small danger of stifling by the sulphureous smoke, or being knocked on "

He says that the gulph or mouth was shaped like a tunnel, and grew narrower and narrower. Being descended to above an hundred paces from the edge or side, they observed one hollow place, about twenty paces in length, and nine or ten broad, filled with water, whence issued a smoke, which was not so thick as to prevent their seeing quite throughit; and very near to this small lake, a blackish stone, the size of which was so prodigious, that they were astonished Barra, a village at the foot of Ex.

Wright himself confesses, the Neapolitans are easiest when they see the mountain burning; for while it has that vent, they are not so apprehensive of those terrible earthquakes which have frequenti, made such havec among them. Their deliverance from the terrors of them, whenever they happen, and their not being consumed by the eruptions or the mountan, which has sometimes filled the very streets of Naples with ashes, they all ascribe to their pro¬ tector S.

M. Nollet, however, rejects their opinions, and confirms that of the mountan’s throw¬ ing out sea water, by an hypothesis which, as it is the most simple, is consequently the best that has the most simple, is consequently the best that has hitherto appeared. THE interior part of Vesuvius, says ne, may be considered as a vast crucible, or rather as the heart of a furnace, in which the burning fuel is mingled with substances that have been melted and vitrified by the violence of the fire. That part of the sur face which is at the bottom of the hollow is exposed to the air, and appears like solid matter; but, as t is perpetually softened by the violent action of the fire within, it gives way from time to the vapors which struggle for vent, and which, when they burst away, bring with them whatever they meet they burst away, bring with them whatever they meet with in their passage. It is, besides, impossible that the vault which covers these immense furnaces should the vault which covers these immense furnaces should not from time to time be so weakened as in some places to give way and fall in. These falling masses may be considered as being cold with respect to the heat of the melted and burning substances upon which they fall, and must therefore suddenly con¬ dense a great part of the vapor which filled the vast cavities below; and a vacuum being thus suddenly produced, the waters of the sea will be necessarily forced by the weight of the atmosphere through the subterraneous canals and crevices which communicatt with the heart of the mountain. This water, thrown upon a fire so ardent as to vitrify the hardest sub¬ stances, must be immediately reduced into vapor or, in other words, expanded so as to fill 14,000 times more space than it filled while it continued to be water. It cannot, therefore, be thought strange, be water. It cannot, therefore, be thought strange, that "

Thus M. Nollet accounts for the periodical eruptions of the mountain, for the earthquakes which precede them, for the sudden sub¬ siding of the sea, and for the waters which are thrown up, and the violent rains which have been generally supposed to happen at the same time, though with¬ out any apparent dependance upon the concomitant phoenomena.

THE name of the city found under Portici, as some workmen were digging the foundation of a pleasure house for the king, was written by Latin authors Herculanum, Herculanium, and more com¬ monly Herculaneum. It has also been called by the poets the City or the Salt-pits of Hercules; Urbs Herculea, Salinae Herculeae. This was one of the most ancient cities in Italy, and is supposed to have been built before the Trojan war. Dionysius, of Hali¬ carnassus, relates that it was founded by Hercules; and though many of the relations os Dionysius ap¬ pear to be fabulous, vet there are many reasons why this ought neither to be suppressed or rejected. Ac¬ cording to him, Hercules having destroyed the ty¬ rants and robbers who infested Spain and Gaul, and civilized the native savages of those countries, passed the Alps, and entered Italy. The fleet which ac¬ companied him into Spain, being detained by con¬ trary winds, could not meet him till after a consi¬ derable time, on the borders of the Sarno, near the foot of Vesuvius. Having in this place consecrate to the gods the tenth part of all the riches which he had acquired, he first built Pompeia, on the spot where he had encamped; and afterwards Hercula¬ neum, at the port where his fleet arrived. These cities were distant about nine miles from each other; and the time when they were built is fixed, by the best chronology, to the 3476th year of the Julian period, 1238 years before the vulgar aera. HERCULANEUM having been totally overwhelmed, we should have been ignorant of the particulars of its situation, if they had not been mentioned by ancient writers. In a passage which Nonnius Mar¬ cellus has preserved from Sisenna, under the word Fluvia, it is said to have stood on an eminence of the mount Vesuvius, upon the sea- coast, and between the mount Vesuvius, upon the sea- coast, and between two rivers, probably the Sarno and Sebetho. Ac¬ cording to Strabo, it was defended by a citadel, built "

Its harbor was secure against all storms, and its air salubrious and delightful in the highest degree. It was suc¬ cessively possessed by the Osques, Cumeans, Tyrians, and Samnites. THE Romans became masters of Herculaneum 293 years before Christ; but it vas not included among the Roman provinces till the sixth consulate of Marius, 100 years before Christ. The agreeable situation of this coast induced many of the principal Romans to build pleasure houses there; and it ap¬ pears that there were several at Herculaneum: Ci¬ cero mentions one that belonged to Fabius, and Se¬ neca mentions another built by C. Caesar. It appears too, by a description which Statius has given of a house of this kind, that they were decorated with the finest pieces of painting and sculpture, the prin¬ the finest pieces of painting and sculpture, the prin¬ cipal performances of Apelles, Phidias, Polycletus, and other Greek masters; which will account for the great number of exquisite remains of ancient art that have been found in the ruins of Hercula¬ neum. This city suffered the first shock by an earthquake, which happened on the gth of February, 63, and continued to waste the neighbouring country during many days. Pompeia was entirely swallowed up, great part of Herculaneum was reduced to ruins, and the rest so shattered that it must have fallen if it had not been repaired by the people when they had recovered from their fright. Six vears and nine months after this accident, on the 1st of November, 76, under the 6th consulate of Titus, the first year of his empire having commenced the preceding Au¬ gust, Herculaneum was totally overwhelmed by an eruption of Vesuvius. Pompeia, which had just been rebuilt, was totally destroyed, and buried, with Her¬ 66 Jupiter, culaneum, under the ruins of Vesuvius. says Statius, who was a cotemporary writer, rooting S 2 "

In its ruins a long inscrip¬ tion has been found, very much damaged and mu¬ tilated, in honor of Vespasian, in whose time many new edifices were probably erected when the damage done by the earthquake in 63 was repaired; and it may be reasonably supposed, that many more me¬ morials of that emperor will be found. 217 IN entering this subter anean, first, there is a steep descent of seventy-two paces, strait forward; then, turning to the right, is another of seventeen ancient steps; after which is seen the appearance of the outside of houses; bases of pillars of brick, some stuccoed and fluted, some standing upright, others overset.

The sulphur being disengaged from the oar, by the action of the fire, passes over in fumes to the empty vessel, where it is first condensed into a fluid, and then hardened into a cake, which is afterwards melted again to refine it, and then made up into rolls. THE substance which contains the allum is found more to the west, and is a kind of earth resembling marle both in color and consistence. This earth, with water enough to cover it, is put into cauldrons of lead, which are sunk into the ground up to the brim.

It has, however, the greatest town in the illand, that goes under the name of Ano-Caprea, and is in several places covered with a very fruitful soil. The eastern end of the ille rises up in preci¬ pices near as high, though not quite so long, as the western.

Several other women stood by for the same purpose; so that, when one was tired, another relieved her by taking her place, while the unfortunate woman kept on all the time. Against the wall of the house near to which she was dancing several women’s petticoats were hung up on a line, all of the most lively colors, but none of a line, all of the most lively colors, but none of black, to which color the party bit has a mortal antipathy. In the midst of her dancing, just as the fancy took her, she would run directly to one of these petticoats, and that she pitched upon was taken down, and put on her. The musick still kept plaving, for that must never cease, and then they began to dance again, till sne fixed upon some other colored petticoat; and in this manner she continued dancing near tyo hours, till her strength being quite exhausted she fell down, but was soon taken up, carried home in an arm-chair, and put to bed.

The Romans, after the defeat of the Samnites, continued it as far as the defeat of the Samnites, continued it as far as Beneventum, where a Roman colony was planted in the consulship of Appius Claudius Crassus, son of the censor, in the year of Rome 485.

Julius Caesar was at great expence in maintaing this road, and actually undertook to drain the marshes of Pomptina; which work was finished in the reign of Augustus, who considerably repaired that part of the road near Capua. The emperors Vespasian and Domitian were at great pains upon the same account; and Nerva expended great sums in repairing it, as appears by inscriptions upon some of the miliary pillars, which have been found in the marshes of Pomptina. The emperor Trajan completed the work begun by his predecessors, continued this road as far¬ as Brundusium, and repavêd another public way, which lay between that place and Beneventum.

THE Via Appia actually began from the city of Rome; and it is well known, that the emperor Augustus set up the gilded pillar at the foot of the Capitol in the Forum Romanum, at which all the military ways of Italy met: but it has been a great question among the antiquarians, whether the dis¬ tances marked with numerals on the pillars, set up on these publick ways, were reckoned from this on these publick ways, were reckoned from this Milliarium Aureum, as from a common center, or whether they were computed only from the gates of the city.

THE town or village of Bovillae was ten miles from Rome; and four miles from thence upon the Via Appia was the Arx Albana, now Albano, built at the foot of mount Albanus, upon which once stood Alba, the mother city to Rome, but destroyed in the first ages of the Romans.

The site of this an¬ cient city is now called Palazzolo, in the neighbour¬ hood whereof stands a beautiful and pleasant villa, which is the ordinary residence of the popes in spring and autumn. From Albano we come to the ancient Aricia, which is sixteen miles from Rome: it is now called Riccia, and stands in a hollow bottom, on which the ancient castle was built. On the lest be¬ vond Aricia were the temple, lake, and sacred grove, of Diana Aricina; and the grotto and fountain of the nymph Egeria, now called Nemi. From hence the road passed below Lanuvium, by a village called Sub Lanuvio, where is now the bridge of S. Genne¬ rello, to the place called Ad tres Tabernas, situated, as Cicero informs us, upon the very spot where the road from Antium to Velitrae crossed the Via Appia. The road then leads through Ad Sponsas to Forum Appii, where the brethren that were, at Rome went out to meet St. Paul; and there is now a church built on the spot where they first met that apostle, when he was brought prisoner to Rome. The Jeru¬  salem itinerary places Ad Medias nine miles from Forum; and we find upon the Via Appia place called Mesa, which has some resemblance to the old name. From Ad Medias to Terracina was ten miles, which "

FUNDI is about fourteen Roman miles from Terra¬ cina, and was a Roman colony frequently mentioned by historians. At the foot of mount Cecuba is a miliary column marked LXXVIII. As we come down from the mountain we arrive at a plain, in which the toyn of Formiae was situated, about four¬ teen miles from Fundi. The Mamurrae, an ancient and illustrious Roman family, had a house at Formiae, the ruins of which are still to be seen at a place now called Murrano. The beautiful prospect which presents itself to the eve at Formiae, its vicinity to the sea, the great plenty of water with which it is the sea, the great plenty of water with which it is supplied, and the fineness and salubrity of its air, renders Formiae extremely pleasant. To the right of the Via Appia, towards a tower now called Torre di Cicerone, and at about 200 paces from the sea, stood a country house belonging to Tully, whither that great orator retired to avoid the fury of the triumviratè, and it was from this place that he embarked to fly into Greece; but, being driven back by contrary winds on the coast of Cajeta, was there barbarously murdered. From Formiae the Via Appia runs partly along the sea-shore to Minturnae, which is situated on the river Liris, now Carigliano, three is situated on the river Liris, now Carigliano, three miles from the sea, and nine from Formiae.

The Via Appia, which passed between Mandragone and the foot of the mountain, led to the Pons Campanus, nine miles the mountain, led to the Pons Campanus, nine miles from Sinuessa, upon the little river Savus, now called Saone, and not far from a place at present called Al Molino de Monachi. The road afterwards passed between the plain of Falernum and the Campus Stel¬ latinus. Four miles from this bridge stood Urbana, since demolished by the Saracens. From the Pons Campanus the road came to a place called Ad Oc¬ tavum, which was at the eighth column reckoning from Capua, and then crossed the Vulturnus over the bridge at Casilinum. This town was made a colony in the year of Rome 694, but was in a ruinous condition in Plinys time, and in wnich it still continues; but it has a very magnificent bridge still remaining entire. The ancient city of Capua being destroyed, count Landon and his brothers built the present Capua partly upon the site of Ca¬ silinum, and transported thither, in the year of Christ 856, the inhabitants of the old city, which stood about three miles from it. Horace, after he had passed the Pons Campanus, arrived betimes at Capua, which was about seventeen miles from that bridge. Old Capua was the capital of Campania; and, in the time of its splendor, not only the rival to imperial Rome, but one of the largest, most magnificent, and opulent cities in the then known world. Writers have varied much in their opinions concerning the origin and time of the foundation of this city, which was of very high antiquity, and undoubtedly more ancient than that of Rome itself. After this city had claimed the protection of the Romans against the Samnites, in the year of Rome 410, its history be¬ came "

In the year of Rome 435 it obtained the privilege of Roman citizens, on account of the great humanity shewed by its inha¬ bitants to the Roman consul and army, who had been obliged to pass under the Furcae Caudinae. No sooner was this city allied to that of Rome, than it pretended to be her rival, and insisted upon the no¬ mination of one of the two consuls. Its senate con¬ sisted of 300 senators, the chief of whom was stiled Medix Tuticus, or sovereign magistrate. Rome haughtily refusing to allow Capua any share in the nomination of the consuls, the Capuans took this re¬ fusal as a very high affront, imbibed an inveterate hatred to the Romans, and sufficiently manifested their resentment after the fatal battle of Cannae. Capua, having entered into an alliance with Han¬ nibal, received him and his army within her walls; a step which proved fatal to her, and was the ab¬ a step which proved fatal to her, and was the ab¬ solute preservation of Rome: for the Carthaginians, softened and enervated by the pleasures and luxury of Capua, were no longer in a condition to resist the power of the Roman arms.

Hannibal in vain attempted to raise the fiege; and notwithstanding he marched to Rome itself, vet the Romans, ani¬ he marched to Rome itself, vet the Romans, ani¬ mated by revenge, chose rather to expose their own country to the fury of an invader than to raise the liege. Capua, being at length abandoned by Han¬ nibal, was forced to surrender to the Romans, and submit to the most rigorous treatment. Its principal senators were put to death, and the inhabitants dis¬ persed: the city was deprived of its laws and ma¬ gistrates, and, being reduced to the state of a pre¬ fecture, was governed by a prefect annually sent thither from Rome.

This magnificent temple had a sacred grove, a circus, a theatre, and extensive buildings for lodging the priestesses. There are still very grand remains of this temple in the church of St. Angelo, which was built upon its ruins. The city of Capua, besides temples, contained other buildings of wonderful¬ grandeur and magnificence, as the capitol, the senate¬ house or curia, the forum or public place, the theatre, the circus, and an amphitheatre built with four rows¬ the circus, and an amphitheatre built with four rows¬ of pillars, and which was almost as large and mag¬ nificent as the Flavian amphitheatre at Rome.

Several villages are built upon the ruins of old Capua, the most considerable ef which is that of Sancta Maria di Capoa, which still preserves the name of the ancient city. the name of the ancient city.

From Galatia the way led to Ad Novas, the distance of which, as marked in the itineraries, corresponds with a village now called La Nova, near Arienzo. From Ad Novas the Road led to Caudium, a town and colony situated in a valley, the entrance into which was by the famous passages anciently called Furcae Caudinae, now Fircia, situated below the castle of Arienzo. THE Via Appia was then continued to Beneventum, one of the most ancient cities in Italy, called for¬ merly Maleventum, which became a Roman colony in 486, and was one of the eighteen colonies that continued faithful to the Romans during the second Punic war. It is now one of the finest towns in Italy, and belongs to the holy see. WHEN the Romans had brought the people of Apulia and its adjacent countries under submission to them, they continued the Via Appia from Bene¬ ventum to Brundusium. The exact time when this part of the road was made is not known; but, as Tully mentions it in his epistles, it is certain that it happened before the fall of the commonwealth. Three different ways led from Beneventum to Brun¬ dusium; one on the right by Venusia and the neigh¬ borhood of Tarentum; the other on the lest by Aecae and Herdonia; and the third ran between the two former through Trevicum, the neighborhood of Asculum, and Canusia. All these three different ways leave Beneventum just without Trajan’s arch, now called Porta Aurea. The way which went to the lest through Aecae, now Troja, divided itself from tyo others which led to Eclarium, the ruins whereof appear near Mirabella.

From hence the road continued along the coast of the Adriatic the road continued along the coast of the Adriatic to Bari, which was a Roman municipium. Finally, the Via Appia continued to Brundusium, and there the Via Appia continued to Brundusium, and there terminated. Brundusium is famous in history on account of its antiquity and the goodness of its port. In the year of Rome 487 it was subdued by the Romans, who planted a colony there in 509. Pom¬ pey retired thither during the civil wars, but was obliged by Julius Caesar to abandon it, and retire into Epirus. It has been several times sacked by the barbarians, but has been rebuilt on account of the goodness of its port. The cathedral church is the goodness of its port. The cathedral church is a magnificent structure, and was built by Roger king a magnificent structure, and was built by Roger king of Sicily.: The sea formerly encompassed three sides of the city; but at present its circumference is very much contracted. Here we see several inscriptions and other monuments of antiquity. The Via Appia that passed near Tarentum came to Brundusium, where it rejoined the Via Trajana.

Should a traveller in protestant countries, or even in France, run from church to church, and take an accurate survey of them, it would be lost labor, and expose him to ridicule. But in Italy it is quite otherwise; for the religious edifices are, in a manner, so many theatres, exhibiting all the beauties of ar¬ chitecture, painting, and sculpture, to the spectators view. As for inscriptions, besides the pleasure which an elegant composition gives the reader, they often an elegant composition gives the reader, they often serve to clear up several passages in civil, literary, or ecclesiastical history; and whoever has not a taste or ecclesiastical history; and whoever has not a taste for these will sind no great entertainment in the tour of Italy. IN the description of the churches we have spe¬ cified a great number of admirable pieces in painting, architecture, and sculpture; vet are such pieces no less frequently to be met with in the palaces of the princes and nobility at Rome, who are generally as lavish in these ornaments as those of other countries are in many articles of luxury.

There were several of these Circi in Rome, as those of Flaminius, Nero, Caracalla, and Severus; but the most remarkable, as the very name imports, was the Circus Maximus. It is said to have been situated between the Palatine and Aven¬ tine mounts. At present, its ruins extend from St. Anastasia to St. Gregorys church, and is taken up with fields and gardens. 7. CARACALLA’S Circus has some remains to be seen near S. Sebastian’s church, in the Appian road; and near it is a square building, called II Spogli¬ arium, where formerly the champions who entered the lists in the circus, and their attendants, dressed the lists in the circus, and their attendants, dressed and undressed themselves. Those also that happened to be killed or wounded in the combats were carried here. 8. THE palace of Augustus has some considerable ruins. 9. THE baths of Titus have some remains of great magnificence. 10 THE cold baths of Caracalla were on the Aventine mount; and it was among the ruins of these baths that the celebrated Toro Farnese, or Far¬ nesian bull, was found. Several of the walls and apartments belonging to these baths are still to be seen among vineyards and gardens. 11. THE baths of Paulus Aemilius are still to be distinguished near S. Maria in the Campo Carleo. * Dionys. I. iii. Plin. l. xxxvi. –- The Circos were places set apart for the celebration of several sorts of games.

THESE catacombs are subterraneous vaults, with variety of windings and turnings, by which the suburbs of Rome are in a manner undermined. They consist, as it were, of several stories or passages under one another; and, as the earth is dry and sandy, these stories are in several places supported with brick-work. On each side are commonly three, four, and five rows of niches, the one above the other, wherein dead bodies used to be laid without coffins. The mouth of each was shut with flat stones, or a kind of large tiles cemented to the opening vith lime or mortar. Many of them are open, and con¬ sequently empty; but a far greater number are still closed, containing as many bodies. † Plin. l.

The first invention of them is attributed to Appius Claudius, a. u. c. 441, who brought water into the city by a channel of eleven miles in length. But this was very inconsiderable to those that were afterwards carried on by the emperors and other persons; several of which were cut through mountains and all other impediments for above forty miles together; and of such an height that a man on horseback might ride through them without the least difficulty: though this meant only of the constant course of the channel, for the vaults and arches were in some places 109 feet high* THE noble poet Rutilius has mentioned these, aqueducts in his ingenious itinerary †.

The Aqua Asiatina was brought by Au¬ gustus from the lake of Bracciano, about thirty-five miles from Rome. Its aqueduct being almost ruined, pope Adrian II. caused it to be repaired; and pope Paul V. completed it with so much magnificence, that it changed its name for that of Aqua Paola. that it changed its name for that of Aqua Paola.

PALACES. AN Italian prince places his grandeur in adorning his palaces with curious decorations, that foreigners may be induced to visit them, and talk of their mag¬ nificence. This humor has been carried to such a pitch, that sometimes we see twenty or thirty rooms on the first and second floor of one of these palaces magnificently furnished only for ostentation, while the family confine themselves to the upper story. This attention to à superb outward appearance has often occasioned conveniency within to be over¬ Iooked. Thus the floors are generally made of brick, or stucco; for marble is thought unwholesome in or stucco; for marble is thought unwholesome in damp weather, and they pretend that boards are not easily kept clean. * See book ii. chap. 3.

THE warmth of this climate necessarily renders the inhabitants fond of villas and gardens, where they may retire in summer for the benefit of fresh air. In England the nobility generally make their country seats the most magnificent, and content them¬ selves with little more than mere conveniences in town: but in Italy it is quite the reverse; the city house is much larger, and generally more splendid, than the villa, which is only intended for a short re¬ treat in the hot season. Therefore, the gardens of these villas have great numbers of shady tall trees and high hedges, with many fountains and water¬ and high hedges, with many fountains and water¬ works. The statues here are generally very nu¬ merous, and enliven the shady retreats. THE principal villas are as follov: I.

This a precious magazine of sculpture, both for statues and basso-relievos. IN the gallery –A crouching Venus, half lise, sitting on a conch, or sea shell, a beautiful statue: Mercury standing upon one leg, in bronze, belonging to the fountain, and made by John of Bologna: Pan learning Apollo to play on the syringe; an ex¬ cellent groupe: a curious vase of white marble, finely performed, and well preserved; it represents the story of Iphigenia going to be sacrificed, with Agamem¬ non, Ulysses, and other figures, encompassing the vase. * Several of these are within the walls: rus in urbe in a literal sense.

AT the greenhouse, in the wall are several trunks of statues, esteemed for their fine drapery. IN the garden, at the bottom, is the famous mar¬ ble groupe of Niobe and her children, as destroyed by Apollo and Diana. The figures are thirteen, besides an old man and a horse, which probably did not belong to them. The two daughters in front are genteel figures, and the dead son is esteemed fine. In Plinys time, this groupe of statues was thought antique, and agreed to be done by Scopas or Praxi¬ teles. The poetical fable of Niobe is related in the sixth book of Ovid’s Metamorphosis, where the attitude of the mother, endeavouring to fhelter her youngest child, is exactly described †. Gronovius supposes the artist to have taken his hint from Ovid; which is a mistake, as this work was made long be¬ fore Ovid was born, who might be supposed to give part of this fable from such accounts as were then generally received, and dressed them out according to his poetical fancy: but the particular description * Pliny, in his Hist.

But there is no certainty that the Niobe in the Villa Medici is the ori¬ ginal mentioned by Pliny; and much less is the skill of Scopas or Praxiteles to be judged of by this performance. Even if Pliny had been more particular in his description, and the Niobe of Medicis had corresponded with it, this would not absolutely decide the point, as many copies were made by the ancients from one admired original, and at present not distinguishable from it. † - Quam to corpore mater † - Quam toto corpore mater Tota veste tegens, unam minimamque relinque, lib. vi.

Giovanni, without the city, and were bought by the great duke Ferdinand. Perrier has engraved them, with the addition of Apollo and Diana in the air, shooting at them: which led father Montfaucon into a mistake, who speaks of those figures as a part of a mistake, who speaks of those figures as a part of the work itself; and other curious, persons, by the sight cf that print, have been led into a supposition, that the work must be in basso-relievo, they likevise taking Apollo and Diana for part of it, and vell knowing it was not likely for statues to be so sus¬ pended in the air. WITHIN the palace are many fine statues: an an¬ tique copy of one of Niobes daughters: a Venus coming out of the bath: Marsyas tied up to a tree to be flayed, excellent: a beautiful Apollo leaning against the stump of a tree, with the right arm brought over his head; a figure well worthy to, ac¬ company the Venus de Medicis: a dying Cleopatra, an excellent figure; the head modern, but good*. That fide of the palace fronting the garden is full of statues and basso-relievos; and at one corner is a votive inscription to Bacchus. Among the busts a votive inscription to Bacchus. Among the busts lare those of veneca, Vitellius, Lucius Verus, and Antoninus Pius, a masterly piece. THE paintings to be seen here are, feventy tuo portraits of eminent personages of several nations: several pieces by del Sarto, Bassano, and other great artists; particularly Christ led to crucifixion, by Gae¬ tano; and the Virgin Mary, with the child Jesus, * The finest piece of all is a dying Cleopatra, which is an exqui¬ site statue, about three times as large as the lise, with a viper twistinę itself round her arm. It exactly resembles that in the Vatican. Ac¬ cording to Plutarch, such an image of Cleopatra was the most distin¬ guished part of the triumphal procession made by Augustus: that image was probably the original, of which this statue is a copy.

Indeed, forced elegance and 1 artificial regularity, which in a manner bear the marks of the rule and compass, afford no lasting and real amulement. OF all the entertainments in Italy, there is nothing more agreeable than that which arises from the ob¬ servation of antique statues*. To see the emperors consuls, generals, orators, philosophers, poets, and other great men, whose fame in history engaged our carliest notice, standing as it were in their own persons before us, gives a man a cast of almost 2000 years backwards, and mixes the past ages with present. We can see the beauties too of those early times; to say nothing of the ideal ones, the nymphs and goddesses. Besides the countenance, we see in the statues the habits of those times, which give a com¬ plete idea of the whole person, and in that respect makè every portrait à history piece. No part of the antiquities of Rome pleased Mr. Addison † so much as the ancient statues, of which there are still an incredible variety. The work¬ manship is often the most exquisite of any thingof its kind. A man would wonder how it were possible for so much life to enter into marble, as may be dis¬ covered in some of the best of them; and even in the meanest we have the satisfaction of seeing the faces, postures, airs, and dress of those that have lived so many ages before us. There is no part of the Roman antiquities that we are better acquainted with than what relates to their sacrifices. For, as * It is not without reason that they say there is a people of statues in Rome. Ficaroni told us (si qua fides) that he had counted 1, 400 in Rome.

As the statues give us the pleasure of the persons of great men, so the basso-relievos give us authentic information of their customs, in their wars, triumphs, sacrifices, marriages, feasts, funerals, and many other particulars.

An Account of all the CEREMONIES observed in Rome at the Opening, and during the Progress, in Rome at the Opening, and during the Progress, of the last JUBILEE, in 1750. THIS Jubilee happens but once in twenty-five years; and the year it falls in is called l’Anno Sancto, or Holy Year. This ceremony is the grandest that imagination can form: no wonder then that strangers, from all parts of Europe, come in multitudes to be spectators of a thing they cannot much expect to see twice in their lives.

THE bull of the pope in 1749, by which he proclaimed the Jubilee of the year following, was read, in Latin and Italian, in tyo different pulpits, in the church of S. Peter’s in the Vatican, by mi¬ in the church of S. Peter’s in the Vatican, by mi¬ nisters appointed for that purpose, with a very loud and distinct voice, on the Ascension-day preceding this important vear. After reading the gospel, a solemn mass was said that day with great pomp and solemnity. Immediately after this publication, four several copies of it were affixed to the east, west, north, and south corners of the city of Rome, as it was practised in the time of pope Urban VIII. in 1624. The next Sunday that bull was also published in the other churches; after which, briefs, or letters, were dispersed to all patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and other superiors of all the provinces and bishops, and other superiors of all the provinces and kingdoms, to notify the celebration of the Jubilee, and to exhort those committed to their care to be more than ordinary zealous in their duty to instruct those who might obtain the happy effects of that sanctified season. THE solemnity of the Jubilee began upon Christ¬ mas eve, in 1750, just before the vespers, by a particular ceremony, that is the opening of the Holy Gate: for the better understanding of which it is necessary to be known, that this Holy Gate is one of St. Peter’s church, and is always bricked up during the intervals of the Jubilees, and by opening it the Jubilee is begun. AFTER dinner, about the vespers of this great eve, the people descend from the Chapel of the Pa¬ lace, and a most solemn procession is made, at which all the foreign embassadors assist, together with the senate and magistrates of the city, all the peniten¬ tiaries and prelates abiding in Rome, the chapters, fraternities, the Roman clergy, college of cardinals, and the sovereign pontiff in person, each according to his rank and quality. Thus they go in pro¬ cession, "

The pope is always the first who kneels; while many officers are em¬ ployed in lighting flambeaux for the cardinals to hold, as a token of joy. The pope then throws some in¬ cense upon a chaffing-dish, with a most profound re¬ verence before the altar. He then begins Veni crea¬ tor spiritus, which is continued by a concert of music, and vocally performed, to the end. FROM thence the procession went in the same order to St. Peter’s cathedral: the pope was carried in a chair to the Holy, Gate, which was closely shut. Every person having taken his place, the pope lest his chair, and with a lighted wax taper in his hand walked up three steps to another chair, or rather throne, placed for that purpose just by the Holy Gate. After a little repose, he got up, and knocked thrice with a gold or silver hammer* on the Holy Gate, which a gold or silver hammer* on the Holy Gate, which was opened. He then assisted in singing an anthem; after which, the masons demolished the wall where¬ with the Holy Gate had been bricked up: and, as they were carrying off the materials, the pope went on with Dominus Vobiscum, and a prayer; after which, the chorus sung a psalm, “ Jubilate Deo, 39 omnis terra. During this time, the people crowded up as near as they could to the rails, and the peni¬ tentiaries washed the Holy Gate with water: after which, the pope entered, chanting some verses, an¬ swered by the chorus, and repeating a prayer, alluding to the Jubilee instituted by Moses. His holiness, with a cross in his hand, was then carried to the great altar, where he mounted a throne, erected for this use, and began the usual vespers. * This always presented to some favourite, who receives itas a mark of signal honor.

Maria Mag¬ giore; which was performed with the same cere¬ monies and prayers. This choice generally falls on two archbishops and the dean, who go from thence with a most magnificent cavalcade, to perform this function; which is like a proclamation to all the Christian world, that the treasure of the church is set open, and distinguisnes the true catholics from heretics and Jews. Some derive this openingof the Holy Gate from a custom practised in the primitive church, where those who had incurred ecclesiastical censure were enjoined to perform some penance, and were excluded from entering the church on Shrove¬ tuesday, by shutting the doors upon them: but on the Holy-thursday, after a general absolution given to all the penitent sinners there, by opening the gates, they are re-admitted and received into the bosom of the church, if they had accomplisned the enjoined the church, if they had accomplisned the enjoined penance; if not, the door was shut against them again till the next year, and sometimes longer. The aile, therefore, having from ancient times been the place assigned to those who underwent the penance, during the time of the church office, this has intro¬ duced the custom of opening the Holy Gate at the beginning of the Jubilee. But as there are four churches that have each a Holy Gate, this hath oc¬ casioned some dispute which of them ought to have the precedency in the performance of this ceremony. the precedency in the performance of this ceremony.

However, when any of these pontifical functions, which have a stricter relation to the papal dignity and authority, a stricter relation to the papal dignity and authority, are to be performed with the utmost splendor, such as the canonizations of saints, the coronations and benedictions of kings, the church of St. Peter has always had the preference before all the rest: and it is upon the same account, that this church claims the is upon the same account, that this church claims the preference in this ceremony, both as to the time and other circumstances; the Holy Gate of St. Peters being the first that is opened by the popes own hands.

It is sufficient to say, that both day and night all the churches are thronged with people, to offer up their pravers; and that there is no street or lane, where public marks of piety are not to be seen among these herded pilgrims. Some make it their business to give alms to the poor with incredible profusion; others are employed in giving a good reception to their for, even when appointed consul, he was not ashamed to imitate his mad master, in turning coachman, and driving chariots along the streets of Rome and the Flaminian way. This related by Juvenal in his eighth satire, where he pleasantly banters the consul on account of his mean spirit in that respect. However, it is from this pitiful wretch that the most celebrated church in Rome, next to St. Peters, and which is called the head and mother of all the other churches, and which is called the head and mother of all the other churches, has borrowed its name.

Great numbers of both sexes appear in penitential dresses, both in the streets and churches; some clad in a long coarse gown, or covered with sackcloth; others with ashes on their heads; and many zealously scourging their bodies in a violent manner. Whole fraternities and congregations stimulate each other to this discipline by their mutual examples. Thus you may observe entire chapters, and colleges of canons, and other societies, enter the city in procession; even whole parishes, with their curates at the head of them, make up the train. With these kind of people all the public places are crowded, as they go in pro¬ cession from different churches; some singing the li¬ tany; others weeping as they offer up their pravers.

It was named Alba from a white sow which the Trojans found in its wood, a white sow which the Trojans found in its wood, as the god of the Tyber foretold to Aeneas, ac¬ as the god of the Tyber foretold to Aeneas, ac¬ cording to Virgil. It was aftervwards called Alba Longa, because it extended a great way along the mountain, to the Lacus Albanus, famous in the Roman history, now called Lago di Castello Gon¬ dolpho, from the popes country seat of that name, which is situated on a most pleasant eminence on one side of it. Alba was governed, for upwards of 400 vears, by fifteen kings and several dictators, being so very powerful as to make Rome and thirty other cities of Latium it colonies. After the combat of the Horatii and Curiatii, it was ruined by order of Tullus Hostilius, and its inhabitants were transported to Rome, where they had the Caelian mount allotted them for their habitation. † Albano keeps up its credit still for wine, which perhaps would be as good as it was anciently, did they preserve it to as great an age; but as for olives, there are now very few here, though they are in great plenty at Tivoli.

Tivoli was formerly called Tibur; and is at present à small town on a rising ground. Its ancient inha¬ bitants had a particular veneration for Hercules, to whom they dedicated a magnificent temple, whose priests were called Herculani Augustani; and the city Herculea, because that god was adored there with as much pomp as Jupiter Capitolinus was at Rome. Its situation, the salubrity of the air, and the fertility of the foil, formerly drew thither a great the fertility of the foil, formerly drew thither a great many people; and it contained so many inhabitants, many people; and it contained so many inhabitants, that it even ventured to make war upon Rome. Tivoli, doubtless, began to be deserted even in the days of Augustus; and at present it is not worth coming to sec, if it was not for the cascade of Te¬ verone and the palace of Modena. The cathedral is built upon the ruins of the old temple of Hercules. and is dedicated to St. Laurence. The tribuna of this church is still a part of the ancient temple, but altogether it makes a poor piece of work; and every thing about the tovn bears an appearance of po¬ verty.

It is circular, with a colonnade of ten Corinthian pillars fluted; a curious freeze above, and a fine soffata within. One window is entire, and is formed wider below than at top*. There were anciently several other temples at Tivoli; particularly that of Igia, commonly called Hygya, daughter to Escu¬ lapius, and known under the appellation of5“ the goddess of health.3 THERE are some ruins, said to be those of Quin¬ tilian’s villa. Opposite to these are those of Mecaenas; and at St. Croce was the villa of Sallust.

The house, gardens, and water¬ works, have been in elegant taste. The house is situated upon a rising ground, from whence is a prospect of all the country round the city of Rome. In the gardens are several fountains, particularly those of Arethusa, Pandora, Pomona, and Flora, with a great variety of statues of Naiads, and other divinities. Above the great fountain are some rocks with Colossian statues, and some little rivulets, which flow through the concavities, and fall into the great bason. Here are also the fountains of Pegasus and Bacchus; with the grottos of Venus and the sybils. The representation of ancient Rome is like puppet¬ shew work: but the great fountain of the Dragons is a noble piece of art. Most of the statues are mutilated; the gardens are neglected; and the whole is now in a ruinous condition. ON the ist of May, we set out on our return to Rome; and just out of the town, in a garden, we sav an antique ruin, called the temple of Bacchus.

It was a municipal place, and has some antique ruins; particularly a fine fountain that adorns the great square. It is a large rock, which supports a pyramid: on the sides are two statues, one of the river Nera, the other a naiad; and a large lion seems as if he wanted to come out of the hollow of the rock. The whole is mutilated, which is a great loss. Here are the ruins of an amphi¬ theatre. The cathedral is a modern edifice: and there are some convents, but without any thing re¬ markable about them.

On the Terra Firma, or continent of Italy, she pos¬ sesses the Trevisan, Paduan, Vicentin, Veroneze, Bergamese, the territory of Brescia, the city of Crema and its district, and the Polesin. They. have also a great part of Friouli, Istria, Dalmatia, and Albania: and they still retain the illands of Corfu, Zante, Cerigo, Firmes, Cuzzola, and Cephalonia. All these countries are rich and fruitful, and the inhabitants carry on a great: trade in the Levant, and other parts of Europe. THE entire revenue of the republic is computed at about eight millions of ducats, and the annual at about eight millions of ducats, and the annual expence does not commonly exceed half that; so that they must lay up large sums.

VENICE was originally a democratical state, under consuls and tribunes, who were succeeded by the doges, of whom upwards of thirty were absolute so¬ vereigns: but, in 1177, it reverted to its democratical state, in which it continued till 1298; and from that period it has been an aristocratical government, the supreme power being lodged in the hands of a cer¬ tain number of families, written in the golden book, which is the register of the Venetian nobility.

When a high one flows, it is of bad consequence, because, as the houses are standing in the water, it then enters the lower parts of them, falls into their drains, and spoils their artificial springs; for they have no other than rain-water that is fresh. Great care is taken to re¬ ceive it at the tops of the houses, and then to purify it; as thus: In the court vard, there is the drain, where all the rain-water falling from the house and other parts runs into; first a bed of sand receives it; then it passes through one of chalk; and in the court is sunk a well, at the bottom of which is placed a is sunk a well, at the bottom of which is placed a filtering stone, where last of all it passes through, and is then taken up clear for use; it is very pleasant, is then taken up clear for use; it is very pleasant, and drinks soft like milk.

The middle of the front is almost all window for enlightening a long portico or gallery, that passes through the house in every story; and out of this gallery you go into the apartments on each hand. The best apartments are apartments on each hand.

But, as we have already given an account of the carnival at Florence*, it is unnecessary to describe this at Venice, it being almost of the same nature; with this difference, that the latter exceeds any thing of the kind in magnificence, and the infinite variety of diversions. THE ceremony of the doge marrying the Adriatic is very pompous, and has been described by many travellers; but having one day seen the doge go in procession to St. Markis church, we shall insert a fhort account of that ceremony.

Then came six other persons, carrying the large banners or standards of the republic: after them was carried a fine velvet chair, whereon was placed a cushion of a fine velvet chair, whereon was placed a cushion of gold brocade.

In a fhort time the doge arose, and approached the altar, where the nuncio began high mass, at the finishing of which the whole procession returned in the same order as the whole procession returned in the same order as they came. Being arrived at the bottom of the great open staircase of the palace, they all stopped, when the doge ascended, seated himself on a gold brocade stool, saluted those of the procession, and retired to his apartments. THE Venetians, for the dignity of their govern¬ ment, would represent their doge as a king; but, for the freedom of it, as a king without power; and so indeed he is, for he cannot do so much of himself as an English justice of peace. all there is the act of the council; and even by the word Principe the whole aristocracy is understood. The doge has not the liberty of the meanest subject, for he is not to the liberty of the meanest subject, for he is not to stir out of the city without leave: therefore he is said to be, “ a king in his robe, a senator in the as¬ sembly, and a prisoner in the city. WITH regard to the manner and genius of the Venetians, we may in general observe, that they are born with a wonderful sagacity to politics, and ma¬ nagement of public affairs, which have been the principal means of rendering their republic a great and flourishing state.

This maxim leads them to that refined piece of policy of bringing up their young nobility in idleness and luxury; of countenancing all manner of excess, and the most profound ignorance in the churches and convents; of cherishing the spirit of faction among the people, of cherishing the spirit of faction among the people, and that of dissentions among the nobility upon the¬ Terra Firma; and of treating with disdain those strangers of merit who are in their pay*, THE inquisition here is no more than a faint shadow of what it is elsewhere; nor are those who profess a of what it is elsewhere; nor are those who profess a religion different from that of the Roman Catholic, within its jurisdiction.

This gives their embassadors a more honorable reception at some courts; but, at the same time, may teach at some courts; but, at the same time, may teach their people to have a mean notion of their own their people to have a mean notion of their own form of government, and is a tacit acknowledgment that monarchy is the more honorable. THIS republic made anciently a very good figure, not only considered as a free state of Italy, but in respect to Europe in general. Her dominions were large, her commerce extensive, and her naval power extremely formidable: but, according to the nature of all commonwealths, fluctuations and revolutions in government have been very common here, and to them it has been chiesly owing that Genoa is so much declined from its ancient wealth and power.

POLICE. –The police is in several respects on a much better footing here than in many other cities of Italy; and the streets are sase at night from assassins and thieves. The love of gain is so preva¬ lent here, that all ranks give into trade: but the laws have put a check upon excessive splendor and luxury. REVENUE. –The annual revenues of the republic are computed at 1, 200, 000 crowns: but they can raise it considerably, as many of their subjects are very rich, and have large estates in other dominions, particularly Naples and Spain; which is attended with great inconveniences, as throwing them into in¬ terests inconsistent with those of their own country¬ DOMINIONS. –The dominions of this state consist of the countries extending along the sea- coast, on both sides, from the city of Genoa, which are called the eastern and western Rivieras.

            "172. CONSTITUTION OF GENOA. COMMERCE. -The commerce of Genoa is also far short of its ancient prosperity and importance; which is owing to the incommodiousness of the harbor, and the high price of all sorts of commodities. Their chief manufactures are velvets and damasks; besides the lesser articles of silk stuffs, brocades, lace, gloves, sweetmeats, fruits, oil, anchovies, and drugs from the Levant. The English have a, consul at Genoa; though no factory as at Leghorn. Many French protestants have chosenrit for their retreat, and are well received. The inquisition has got footing here, but uses no great strictness towards foreigners. There are no Jews tolerated at Genoâ; which makes the other Italians say, the Genoese are so cunning, that it vould be impossible for a Jew to get bread among 7 them.

However, of late vears, many of them have given very far into the modes of the French; but the common people retain their old prejudices against that nation several ac¬ counts. UPON the whole, it is an amazing thing to see the present desolation of Italy, when we consider what incredible multitudes of people it abounded with during the reigns of the Roman emperors, We may reckon, by a very moderate computation, more inhabitants in the Campania of old Rome than are now in all Italy. It can scarce be imagined how so plentiful a soil should become so miserably un¬ so plentiful a soil should become so miserably un¬ peopled, in comparison of what it was formerly; and this desolation appears no where greater than in the territories of the pope, which perhaps may be ascribed to the very genius of the Roman ca¬ be ascribed to the very genius of the Roman ca¬ tholic religion itself.
