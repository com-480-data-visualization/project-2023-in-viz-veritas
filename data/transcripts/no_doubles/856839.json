            "CHAPTER I. THE CARNIVAL IN ROME. THE Duke of Wellington was once asked which was the best description of the battle of Waterloo, and in the course of his reply he said, that it was impossible to describe a battle : each person could recall and re¬ late the incidents in which he himself took part, but nothing more : whatever was beyond his own observa¬ tion could make no impression the memory. This remark applies with more or less force to every thing which comprises the elements of time and movement. A picture or a bas-relief may be described distinctly and perfectly ; but a series of actions, only in detail by parcels, and more or less imperfectly. A land¬ scape may be painted with the most minute fidelity but no eye can catch, no memory retain, the succes¬ sive and fleeting impressions made upon it by a violent storm. This especially true of the gay movements and genial frolic of a Roman Carnival ; every description of which must needs be unsatisfactory to those who never witnessed it, and disappointing to those whe have.

He can tell of quaint disguises, of voluble speech, of rapid gestures, of showers of bouquets, and a steady rain of sugar-plums, of streets gorgeous as an autumn wood with hanging tapestry, and of balconies filled with women wearing their gayest gowns and their brightest smiles ; but he cannot transfer to his page the atmosphere of frolic which hangs over all, inter- prets all, and reconciles all — to which each contributes his part, while all feel and share its electric influence.

EMERSON. To judge fairly of a Roman Carnival, we must view it in connection with the prevailing tastes, the ordinary it in connection with the prevailing tastes, the ordinary amusements, and every-day life of the Roman people; and inquire into the causes which have made it, here, so much more an absorbing and characteristic a spec- so much more an absorbing and characteristic a spec- tacle than in other Catholic capitals. The taste of the populace of Rome has been in some degree formed by those splendid and imposing ceremonials of the church with which they have been so long familiar: by the gilding and marble of their churches, the rich vestments of the clergy, the clouds of incense curling up from censers of silver, and all the other shows and                                       "

On all holiday occasions they hang out from their windows strips of bright-colored cloth. They take great pleasure in illuminations, torch-light processions, and, especially, in fire-works, which are no where seen in such perfection as in Rome. Even death itself is in such perfection as in Rome. Even death itself is not exempt from the influence of this ruling passion. The funerals of distinguished persons take place at night, are illumined by the blaze of torches, and attended by solemn music and trains of ecclesiastics. Thus, the Carnival is linked by natural laws to the remaining portions of the year. It is merely the an¬ nual flowering of that taste which is always in leaf. Something is also to be ascribed to the peculiarity of the place — the Corso and the streets immediately adjoining — to which the show is confined. The Corso is about a mile long, but disproportionately narrow - is about a mile long, but disproportionately narrow - being on an average only about thirty-five feet broad and bordered by lofty houses, nearly all of which are furnished with projecting balconies, constructed with especial reference to this spectacle. When apart- ments are let in this street for the season, the period of Carnival is not included, except by a special agree¬ ment, and for an additional consideration. Tempo¬ rary structures of wood are usually put up, where permanent balconies are wanting. Thus, the already narrow space between the houses is abridged by these unglazed oriels and projections, and the persons oc- cupying them are brought within speaking, or, at least, communicating distance; near enough to interchange bouquets, sugar-plums, and smiles of greeting. And as the street between is densely filled with carriages and                                   "

Nor does the sport last through the whole of each day, but only from about two o’clock till dark, in the short days of February ; so that the Romans, even in their hours of license, feel the truth of Hesiod’s saying, that the half is more than the whole, and know that fine flavors can only be pre¬ served by abstaining from deep draughts. The course of each day is substantially the same, except that the uproar goes on with an increasing impulse, as the end draws near. The reader will then have the goodness to walk with me into the Corso, at about half past two to walk with me into the Corso, at about half past two on a Carnival day, and follow with the mind’s eye the sketch of the moving scene which I shall attempt to draw ; and in this, our airy substance, we can pene¬ trate to the heart of the crowd much more easily than if we were making the effort in our proper material persons. First of all, the aspect of the long and narrow street draws the admiring eye. The usually rather common¬ place and unexpressive fronts of the houses have sud¬                                  "

Gay streamers, of red, yellow, and blue, flutter in the breeze, and heavier pieces of the same vivid colors hang from the windows in such numbers, that to a fan¬ ciful mind it looks as if a rainbow had fallen from the sky, and its shattered fragments been caught and arrested ere they reached the earth. Far as the eye çan pierce, the balconies are crowded with spectators, of whom a larger proportion are gaily dressed women; some with beautiful, and all with animated faces, pre¬ pared to enjoy the scene and not unwilling, to be admired. The street below is filled by two rows of carriages slowly moving in opposite directions, and filled with gay occupants, and by a motley crowd of foot-passengers, composed principally but not exclu¬ sively, of men and boys, some with masks and some without. All this concourse comprising every rank in life, from an adventurous English nobleman to the lowest ragamuffins in Rome, and engaged more or less actively in one common occupation, that of pelting one another with various kinds of missiles; so that the air is quite filled with the harmless ammunition of their mock warfare. These missiles are of three classes — rejecting all minor subdivisions as unworthy of the dignity of history — these three are flowers, bon-bons or sugar-plums, and confetti. For many days before the Carnival begins, flowers are brought into Rome from the neighboring country ; and the stock on hand to respond to the uni¬ versal demand, seems boundless. They are so ar¬ ranged as to meet the various capacities of purse or                                   "

They are, as with us on the eve of a ball, a graceful and permitted attention which might be too marked, if proffered on other occasions; and there as here, a sharp eye may draw auguries of hope or fear from the manner in which they are received and acknowledged. The instinctive and universal taste of mankind selects flowers for the expression of its finest sympathies, their beauty and their fleetingness serving to make them the most fitting symbols of those delicate sentiments for which language itself seems almost too gross a medium. In some instances, these Carnival bouquets are crowned with a living bird whose legs and wings are imprisoned in flowery bands, and whose drooping head wears a forlorn expression of surprise and terror, awakening a feeling not in unison with the mood of the hour. As the sugar-plums are good to eat, they have a homely savor of utility and fall short of the ethereal expressiveness of flowers; but as tributes, they are valued by young and old; especially when tastefully enclosed in pretty boxes and cones of gilded paper, bearing likenesses of damsels with pink cheeks and invisible mouths. Of the cheaper sort, a considerable proportion falls upon the pavement and is eagerly scrambled for by the ingenuous youth of Rome, who dart in and out under the wheels of carriages and the hoofs of horses, with a courage worthy of a better cause.

The third class of missiles — the confetti —are bits of lime, of which the average size is about that of a of lime, of which the average size is about that of a well-grown pea, forming quite a serious weapon of attack. Indeed, discreet persons, who mean to go through the thick and thin of a Carnival, protect their faces by masks of wire against assaults which might otherwise do lasting harm, especially to the eyes. They are sometimes thrown by the hand some- times skilfully ejaculated through a tin tube. When a quantity of them is forcibly and unexpectedly hurled into the unprotected face, the first sensation is as if the points of a thousand needles had been suddenly shot into the skin; and then a cloud of darkness settles down upon the eyes which gradually passes off in a rain of tears; leaving the sufferer, if of an irritable temper, much disposed to “pitch into’ somebody. Foreigners, the English especially, are said to abuse this privilege of the confetti. The Italians, whose tem- perament allows only a short transition from gentle courtesy to fiery excitement and the drawing of knives, and who do not understand the good-humored horse- and who do not understand the good-humored horse- play of rougher nations, rarely use them. The most animated contests with these different missiles take place where two carriages, occupied by young persons of different sexes, are detained oppo¬ site to each other by a general lock ; or under a balcony which sparkles with more than average proportion of beauty. On these occasions, and at these points, the air is darkened with sugar-plums and flow¬ ers, the ladies receiving them gracefully as a just tribute that conquerors do not return. The confetti, be it observed, with persons of good taste, are never used it observed, with persons of good taste, are never used except in masculine encounters.                                    teeter "

Of the mass which elbow one another through the crowded streets, the greater part are in their ordinary garb ; though disguises are common enough not to at¬ tract any particular attention. Among the most usual masks are punchinellos with portentous noses and pro¬ tuberant waistcoats ; harlequins in striped costume and daggers of pasteboard ; quack doctors with ludicrous nostrums for all sorts of diseases ; and advocates in gowns and wigs, that threaten the passers-by with in¬ dictments for a thousand fanciful crimes. Many of the masks carry an inflated bladder at the end of a stick, with which they strike most resonant blows to the right and left — a form of practical joke which never seemed to lose its point, nor failed to call forth peals of laughter. to lose its point, nor failed to call forth peals of laughter. Many of the women appeared in male attire, partially or entirely ; a style to be ascribed more to convenience or entirely ; a style to be ascribed more to convenience of locomotion in such a crowd than to any innate pro¬ pensity of the sex to assume what does not belong to them. At any rate, the change was a sacrifice, for the feet and ancles of the Roman women are made for use and not for show. Some persons simply draw over their common garb a dress of coarse white cotton, adopted as much by way of protection against the lime of the confetti, as for a disguise. When to this attire a white mask is superadded, the wearer looks like the a white mask is superadded, the wearer looks like the ghost of a miller walking abroad at noon-day. remember one adventurous person who presented a tolerable impersonation of a green monkey. In the carriages which pass in a straight line up and down the Corso, there is such a variety as to form by themselves an entertaining spectacle. Many of them are the common equipages usually seen in the streets,                                  "

There are also many which are rigged out especially for the occasion consisting of an open frame-work, resting upon wheels, rudely and hastily put together, but successful in the general effect. Sometimes they are contrived to re¬ semble a ship, sometimes, a moving forest; and in all cases, the decorations and the garb of the occupants are in what Tony Lumpkin calls “a concatenation accord¬ in what Tony Lumpkin calls “a concatenation accord¬ ingly, so that the sense of congruity is not disturbed In carriages of this class very elaborate and effective costumes may sometimes be seen. I recall two young ladies in rich Albanian dresses, who attracted much at- tention ; and also a party of young men in the velvet doublets and feathered hats of Sir Walter Raleigh’s time. The coachmen appear in some fantastic and extravagant garb, their horses garnished with flowers and ribbons; the great object being to attract notice. There are three modes of seeing and sharing in the festivities of the Carnival : one is to look at the scene from a window or a balcony : another, to ride up and down the Corso in an open carriage : and the third, from which ladies are debarred, is to mingle with the crowd in the street. An adventurous young man will probably make experiment of all. To be merely a passive spectator soon wearies the eye, and if in a cynical humor, provokes a critical spirit and a wonder that men and women can behave so like boys and girls To rough it in the street requires a stout frame and nimble feet. The carriage is the best medium, making thè occupant at once an actor and a spectator. It is quite curious to remark how a fastidious dignity melts                                  V "

Between taking a part and merely looking on, there is the same difference as between dancing and seeing others dance. The mob, gentle or simple, seems uniformly good-humored, though sometimes a little self-command must be exerted in order to main- tain this genial mood. A handful of confetti is sud¬ denly slapped into your face, bringing a vision of ten thousand dancing stars before your eyes — or as your hand hangs listlessly for a moment over the side of the carriage with a choice bouquet in it, for which vou have a particular destination in your mind or heart, a cunning varlet snatches it from your grasp and disap¬ pears in a twinkling — all this must be taken as a part of the fun, and endured with a smiling composure. Many shafts and sallies of verbal wit pass to and fro among the Italians which are lost to the foreign ear. On one occasion, when riding in the Corso with a young friend, whose blooming complexion and light hair, joined to an expression at once frank and fine, made him an attractive image of Saxon beauty, we were met by a carriage moving in an opposite direction, in which was a lively Italian girl, her dark eyes running over with frolic and mischief, who, when she saw my com¬ panion, threw a bouquet at him, calling out at the same time, in a loud and laughter-broken voice, Beefsteak et pomme de terre,’ a phrase by which the English are known all over the continent.

            "11 THE CARNIVAL IN ROME. Nowhere does beauty find a more marked or more abundant homage than in a Roman Carnival. The Italians, with their vivid temperament and susceptible organization, are quick to detect its presence, and ex¬ pressive in the acknowledgment of its claims. A fine countenance gathers a harvest of applause, and brings round its owner a shower of substantial tokens of admi- ration. In looking down the Corso, wherever a denser crowd is seen gathered together, wherever a brisker fire of flowers and sugar-plums is observed to be going on, one may be sure that the cynosure is a beautiful face that beams from a neighboring balcony. Our own fair countrywomen had, at least, their full share of the general tribute. Two lovely sisters in particular, one of whom, from the rare combination of blonde hair and of whom, from the rare combination of blonde hair and dark eyes, was an object of much admiration to the Italians, were almost the belles of the Corso; and one of the pleasures of each day was to witness the spark- of the pleasures of each day was to witness the spark- ling triumph with which they shewed the various offer¬ ings which had been laid at their feet. I noticed in the hands of some of the young men on foot, a curious contrivance for the transmission of flow. ers to the upper windows. It is a sort of frame-work of wooden slats turning upon pivots. When folded to- gether and lying horizontally, they occupy but little space, but by a sudden movement they can be elon¬ gated some fifteen or twenty feet, darting up into the air like a rocket. A bouquet, fastened to the end of this, and held in a firm grasp, thus mounted in safety, and reached the very hand for which it was predestined. And thus the merry-making goes on till about five o’clock, when preparations begin for the running of the                                  "

Mounted dragoons appear in the Corso, and the carriages one by one diverge into the neighboring the carriages one by one diverge into the neighboring streets on the right and left ; and in a short time all disappear, and foot-passengers alone are left. A de- tachment of cavalry moves slowly down the Corso and returns on a brisk trot. In the mean time, the horses which are to run, have been brought to the starting point in the Piazza del Popolo, and are rearing and snorting with impatience to be let go. A temporary semicircular range of seats has been previously erected in the Piazza, looking down into the Corso ; and just in the Piazza, looking down into the Corso ; and just in front of these seats is the barrier, behind which the horses are ranged. Each horse is led up by a shewily dressed groom, who stands at his head till the signal for starting is given. The impatient animals rear and plunge, and the struggles which ensue between them and their keepers, often graceful and vigorous young and their keepers, often graceful and vigorous young men, lead to fine exhibitions of human, as well as ani¬ mal power. Accidents sometimes occur, especially when the number of horses is large, as the space in which they are crowded is only of moderate extent. The signal is at last given, the confining rope falls, and the horses bound forth, swallowing the ground with the horses bound forth, swallowing the ground with fiery leaps. They rush down the narrow Corso, the people opening a passage for them like waves before the keel of a ship, and then closing up behind them. the keel of a ship, and then closing up behind them. When 1 first witnessed this plunging of these spirited creatures into a thronged street, it seemed to me a perilous sport, and I asked if accidents never occurred. and was told that they never did ; but the question seemed to be prophetic, for on that very day one man was killed outright, and two or three were wounded.

They are goaded on in their course by leaden balls, into which sharp points are inserted, and so hung upon their backs as to pierce them with every movement. They run the length of the Corso and are brought up at the Piazza Veneziana, where a temporary seat is érected for the judges who award the prizes. The horses are a light-limbed and spirited breed of animals, but they a light-limbed and spirited breed of animals, but they have little opportunity to shew their real qualities of speed or endurance in a race of this kind. From the narrowness of the street, also, an unfair advantage is given to the one or two that get the start at the begin- ning, which lessens the interest in the result. Goethe, who was in Rome in 1788, says, that time car¬ riages were not driven out of the Corso before the run- ning of the horses, but were merely drawn up in a line on each side, leaving only the narrow space between on each side, leaving only the narrow space between them for the race-course ; and that sometimes the horses would dash against the wheel of a carriage with such force as to kill themselves. With the running of the horses, the out-of-door amusements of the Carnival cease. The crowd in the Corso disperses, and in a few moments the streets are restored to their usual quiet and silence. In the even¬ ing, there are various social entertainments, and com- monly a masked ball at some one of the theatres. Such, substantially, was the Carnival of 1848 as it dwells in my memory. I confess that before the eight days were over, it began to grow wearisome. It was like a Christmas pantomime acted by daylight. There were, however, some adverse elements at work which impaired the effect, and threw a dispiriting influence                                  "

The sun rarely shone during the whole period, and the only change was from a dull gray sky to a drizzling rain. For such raree-shows the presence of sunshine is indis- pensable. The gay colors look intrusive and imperti¬ hent under a monotonous and leaden sky. The mummers and maskers, stumping through the mud and trying to ignore the rain, reminded one of a flock of peacocks disconsolately pacing round a farm-yard in an easterly storm — their fine feathers draggling in the wet or plastered to their sides with moisture. In this, as in so many other instances, our daily speech express¬ es the general sense of mankind. It is not without es the general sense of mankind. It is not without reason that we say that our ardor has been damped. and that cold water has been thrown upon our zeal. All out-of-door amusements, picnics, water-parties, civic processions, military reviews, are dreary failures, unless the sun looks down upon them with a benignant countenance. At the bottom, there was no great amount of hearti¬ ness and abandon, and a good deal of make-believe. Thère was a sufficient reason for this state of feeling. in the political excitement at that time so rife among in the political excitement at that time so rife among the Roman people, and in the vague and glowing hopes the Roman people, and in the vague and glowing hopes which played before their dazzled eyes.

In consequence of these transactions, and by way of sympathy with those who had fallen, the people, at the suggestion of their political leaders, gave up the usual concluding amusement of the Carnival, the Moccoletti, in which every person carries a lighted taper, and en- deavors to protect his own and extinguish that of his neighbor. It was in the midst of the entertainments of the Carnival that we heard of the French revolution of the Carnival that we heard of the French revolution of February, 1848, an event which broke in upon the frivolous piping and dancing, like the crashing stride of an earthquake. After this astounding intelligence, it was difficult to enter into the spirit of the scene, or to bar the mind, for even a moment, against the stern realities that knocked for admittance. To a thoughtful spirit, aware of the pregnant significance of this outbreak and not of the pregnant significance of this outbreak and not least of all to the Romans themselves, the frisking and capering of the crowds in the Corso seemed like the dancing of a parcel of monkeys over a powder maga zine. It is evident from the accounts of former travel¬ lers, that the interest and animation of the Carnival are gradually passing away. Indeed, it can hardly be oth- erwise. Communities, as well as individuals, have their periods of youth, manhood, and decay. As the people of Rome grow older and more thoughtful, as the sense of the duties and responsibilities of life presses upon of the duties and responsibilities of life presses upon especially if they should emanci¬ them more heavily — pate themselves from their state of political minority it cannot but happen that the inclination towards a style it cannot but happen that the inclination towards a style of amusement so essentially boyish must pass away.

A Carnival will not be in unison with the ripened taste of a people that have reached the full stature of moral and mental manhood. Goethe has given a description of this amusement as he saw it at the close of the last cen¬ tury, in a sketch full of grace and spirit — written in that beautiful and transparent prose which forms not the least among his great literary merits — from which the reader will see how much the Roman Carnival has the reader will see how much the Roman Carnival has been tamed and sobered in the course of sixty years. But if it has lost in vivacity, it has gained in refinement and decorum : the better taste of to-day would hardly tolerate some of the incidents which he records.                 "

But now this latter region is the most densely peopled part of Rome; while the highlands are comparatively de- serted. This change of the seat of population was probably determined, in a great measure, by the nearness of the river. The ancient aqueducts were mostly all destroyed, or abandoned to neglect and decay, during the dark centuries of Rome. The restoration of such as were restored was comparatively recent. For many generations, a large part of the inhabitants could have depended only on such sources of water as were within the walls. On this account, the poorer classes would naturally the walls. On this account, the poorer classes would naturally fix their habitations as near as possible to the Tiber. VOL. II. 2                          "

Besides its imme¬ morial seven hills, it now includes three others, the Janiculum, the Monte Pincio, and the Vatican ; to say nothing of the artificial Monte Testaccio.

The view from the Pincian Hill, for instance, is that with which stran¬ gers are most familiar ; and let us consider for a mo¬ ment some of its peculiarities. An American eye'is first struck with the absence of that dingy red brick which predominates so tyran- nically over all our cities ; to the despair of artists and the discomfort of those who are born with the sense of the discomfort of those who are born with the sense of art. This glaring color is quite unknown in Rome. The buildings are, as a general rule, of stone, or cov- ered with stucco; or if brick be used, it is painted; and the different hues of the architectural scene being variations of the same ground tone, blend to the eye in one uniform tint of cream or stone color, with patches one uniform tint of cream or stone color, with patches of ashen gray; all which is in beautiful unison with the blue sky and the green ring of plain and mountain the blue sky and the green ring of plain and mountain which the city is set. in which the city is set. The next most conspicuous peculiarity is the variety and irregularity of the air line. The formal horizontal monotony of our blocks of building are nowhere to be seen. Though there are no spires properly so called there are for they are Gothic in their origin — multitudes of towers and domes, obelisks, columns, belfries, stately palatial masses, convents and churches. To these are to be added the irregularities of the sur- face of the soil. Thus, the outline or profile traced upon the sky by the projection of all these architec- tural forms is singularly indented, irregular, and broken. Rome shoots out into the gulf of the sky a great num¬ ber of capes and promontories. These two elements of color and outline are both favorable to the training of the artist, for on whatever spot his eye may light, it                                   "

This pic¬ turesque character of Rome is the great secret of that magic spell which it throws over every artist who dwells within its borders : an influence, which like that exerted by a fine climate upon a sensitive frame, is more felt after it is removed than while it is enjoyed. is more felt after it is removed than while it is enjoyed. Artists, like all mortal men, are sometimes unreasona- ble and inconsistent, and will speak of Rome with disparagement or indifference while it is before them; but no artist ever lived in Rome and then left it, with- out sighing to return. From the irregularity of surface in the site of Rome. and from the power thus afforded of looking down, as well as above and around, we are admitted to view many interior pictures, and to see the reverse side of the tapestry of life. Rome is a city of wide spaces, and luxuriates in elbow-room; and the buildings are and luxuriates in elbow-room; and the buildings are not crowded, shoulder to shoulder, except in a few places. All the larger houses are so built as to enclose a court-yard, and many of them have patches of gar- a court-yard, and many of them have patches of gar- den-ground in the rear. In looking down into these court-yards, the observant eye will meet with frequent subjects and hints for the artist; in the moulding of a window, in a projecting balcony, an ornamented a window, in a projecting balcony, an ornamented frieze, or in an orange-tree, whose dark foliage and golden fruit stand out in the happiest contrast with the gray hues of the wall. the gray hues of the wall.

The charm of cleanliness belongs neither to Rome nor its people. The sense of beauty and the sense of neatness and order do not necessarily dwell in the same natures. The Italians, who have so much of the for- mer, are sparingly endowed with the latter. But in Rome even dirt becomes picturesque.

The grocer’s shop will have a dirty floor, and a dingy, stained wall; but he will dispose his hams, his round buffalo cheeses, and his strings of Bologna sausages so as to produce a certain picturesque effect : he will ornament his wares with flowers and branches of laurel, and on the evenings of the great church holidays will set up an image of the Madonna, and burn candles before it.

Rome is also remarkable for the number and variety of the costumes seen in its streets. In Italy, as in continental Europe generally, the various ranks in social life are marked, more or less broadly, by a dis¬ tinctive costume. The cast-off garments of one class are never worn at second-hand by another. The rural population dress as their fathers and mothers did be¬ fore them, and attach a certain element of dignity and self-respect to this adherence. The different localities in the neighborhood of Rome — such as Albano, Fras- cati, Subiaco — are marked generally by certain dis¬ tinctive peculiarities, especially in the costume of the female portion of the population ; though there is a common likeness running through them all, like the resemblance of features in the members of the same family. The peasant who comes to Rome in the cold days of winter, wraps himself up in the folds of an ample brown cloak, which he wears with ease and sometimes with grace. In fine weather, he sets off his steeple-crowned hat with flowers or ribbons. His waistcoat, revealed by a scanty jacket, is of scarlet cloth, adorned with the gayest of buttons, and perhaps embroidered with gold or silver. His breeches are tied at the knee with shewy ribbons, or fastened with silver buckles; and his legs are protected by strong leathern gaiters. Around his waist he wears a woollen scarf. and the ends of a shewy cravat flutter in the breeze. The peasant woman wears a boddice of a gay color.                                  "

Her gown is short enough to allow full justice to be done to the shining buckles in her shoes. But the most striking part of her costume is the head¬ dress, which, with many slight variations according to the locality, is always handsome and becoming. It is usually of white linen, lying in a square fold upon the top of the head, and fastened to the hair, which is gathered in a mass on the back of the head, by a silver arrow ; the shape of which designates the condition of the wearer, whether married or unmarried. Some- the wearer, whether married or unmarried. Some- times this linen head-dress is disposed more like à veil — or it is gathered in the form of a hood or it blends with a similar covering over the shoul- ders and bust, in a way which a masculine pen is not competent to describe, nor a masculine memory to retain ; but it serves so well the purposes both of em¬ bellishment and protection, and being always scrupu¬ lously clean, is so suggestive of purity, that we have every reason to be grateful that these sturdy women have resisted the general invasion of bonnets. The great number of ecclesiastics who are found in Rome also contribute to increase the variety of costume which is noticed in the streets. The Roman Catholic idea of the character and functions of the clergy, whether secular on monastic, requires that they should be marked by a distinguishing dress, as men severed from all the common ties and relations of life, and dedi¬ cated exclusively to spiritual duties. One cannot look out of a window in Rome, without seeing one or more out of a window in Rome, without seeing one or more figures in flowing robes of black, and capacious and overshadowing hats, moving gravely along, and hardly                                  "

Even the youths who study in ecclesiastical establishments appear in a similar garb, which is in marked contrast with their quick movements and animated faces Mixed with these are the Capuchin friars, who wear a robe of coarse, brown woollen, girded around the waist with a cord ; a dress well-suited for the purposes of an artist, but repulsive, from the want of cleanliness which it suggests.

The cardinals and higher dignitaries of the church never appear in the streets on foot.* the church never appear in the streets on foot.* Nor should the artists be overlooked in summing up the characteristic peculiarities of Rome. They form a numerous class, and their identity of pursuits and in- terests goes far to obliterate the distinctions of birth and language. They affect, especially the younger portion of them, certain eccentricities and fantasticalities of dress, which serve to point them out to the eve and mark their profession. They seek to escape from the sober and prosaic costume of the day into the more flowing outlines of older periods or more remote climes. They wear jaunty caps or hats of flexible felt moulded * This rule is inflexible. The Church will not permit its cardinals to be exposed to such involuntary disrespect as might happen from the crowds in a street. Cardinal Rohan, Archbishop of Besançon, asked as a particular favor from Gregory XVI. that he might walk from his lodgings to the Trinità de’ Monti, where he said mass, as the distance was short. But in spite of his illustrious birth, the great sacrifices he had made for the church, and the personal friendship of the pontiff, his request was refused. The pope desired him to ask any thing else, but that was impossible. Gaume : Les Trois Rome. Tom. 1, p. 407.                                  "

They are fond of velvet or vel¬ veteen coats, loosely and ' curiously cut ;’ often orna¬ mented with braid, and sometimes garnished with buttons as big as dollars. Their waistcoats are of the gayest patterns, daubed over with great blotches of color jumbled together like a distracted rainbow.

About Christmas time, there appear in the streets some picturesque and characteristic groups not noticed at other periods of the year. There are the Piferari, so called, shepherds from the Abruzzi and the Sabine mountains, who make an annual pilgrimage to Rome to play before the various portraits of the Virgin.

Their dress is partly of coarse : cloth, and partly of skins; and they wear a kind of san- dal upon their feet, bound round the ancles with thongs. Their conical hats, which they always reverently lay aside when playing, are adorned with gay ribbons. Dark eyes gleaming through long elf-locks of glittering black give a marked character to their countenances. They arrive about a week before Christmas, and during that time they employ themselves with the greatest dili¬ gence, not only during the day but often late into the night, in going about the streets and playing before the various images of the Madonna, with a grave and éarnest expression of face, shewing that they regard their occupation to be the performance of a religious duty. The groups which gather around them on these occasions, always listen with devout attention. Their music is wild, loud, and piercing ; but when heard in the stillness of night, and at a short distance, it is plain¬ tive and impressive. The effect which it produces is enhanced by those associations, which link these pas- toral groups with those shepherds of Bethlehem that were sent by angel voices to the manger where the child Jesus lay.

At the base of the obelisk is a fountain, with four rounded basins radiating from a common centre like the leaves of a stalk of four-leaved clover — a stream of water gushing into each basin from the mouth of a lioness carved in stone.

Op- posite the gate are two churches, exactly alike in size and form, each furnished with a dome and tetrastyle, and looking like architectural twins, claiming admira- tion not for their beauty (for the design is common- place) but for their resemblance.

So many are the occasions that bring the foreign residents to the Piazza di Spagna, that an Englishman or American who should station himself in the midst of it, on a fine day, would, in the course of a few hours, be able to speak with nearly all his acquaintances without stirring from the spot. The fountain the Piazza di Spagna is in the shape of a boat, from which its name, Fontana della Barcac- cia is derived. This form was adopted from necessity. as the head of water is not sufficient for a jet of any considerable height; and the designer should rather be commended for what he has done than blamed for what he has not. As an object of taste, the fountain neither pleases nor offends. But we overlook its de- fects, or more properly its wants, in view of the magnifi¬ cent flight of steps of travertine, at the base of which it is placed. This flight of steps leads from the Piazza di Spagna to the promenade on the Pincio, and crown- ed as it is with the façade of the Church of the Trinità de’ Monti, and the Egyptian obelisk in front of the church, it forms one of the noblest architectural com¬ binations to be seen in Rome or any where else.

A sturdy contadino in a smart jacket, a conical hat gay with feathers and ribbons, goat-skin breeches, leggings, and sandals, can be turned with a few strokes of the pencil into a bandit or a shepherd. A young mother in a red boddice and head-dress of snowy linen, with one child in her lap and another sporting at her feet, pre- sents a group that may be idealized into a Madonna with the infant Saviour and St. John. Young men and women, half-grown lads and budding maidens, dressed in the various costumes of the neighborhood of Rome the mountain air brown upon their cheeks and the mountain spirit sparkling through their eyes — stand ready to walk into a canvas to give life to an Italian vintage or harvest-home. Some of the young women wear an expression of embarrassment and conscious¬ ness, and drop their eyes with a smile and half-blush when they meet the glance of a stranger, but most of them take it very coolly and in a business-like way.

' MONTE PINCIO. Having ascended the splendid flight of steps which leads from the Piazza di Spagna to the Trinità de’ Monti, the traveller, turning to the left, will reach in a few moments' brisk walking the public promenade known to the Roman world, foreign and indigenous, as the Monte Pincio. The fine building passed on the right is the Villa Medici, which has, perhaps, the very noblest situation in Rome, at once elevated and se¬ cluded, and commanding a wide prospect of the most varied beauty. To Michael Angelo is ascribed the architecture of the garden façade; which is rich and showy, and has a general resemblance to the designs introduced by Claude Lorraine into his landscapes. The gardens, upwards of a mile in circuit, are laid out in rectangles and formal alleys, and divided by broad gravel walks overhung with trees. Many fragments of ancient sculpture are scattered through them. They are neatly kept and freely accessible to the public; which, however, does not often avail itself of the privi- lege thus courteously proffered. To those whose taste or temperament leads them to shun the noise of crowds and choose the soothing presence of retirement, these gardens present a most congenial attraction. •Though within a stone’s throw of the most animated part of                                "

On the eastern side the gardens are flanked by the walls of the city, and in this direction a grand expanse of mountain and plain unfolds itself to the eye. This villa is now, and has been for a long period the seat of the.French Academy of Fine Arts. Twenty- four students, in the departments of painting, sculpture. music, and architecture, are maintained here at the expense of the government for a certain number of vears, after having given proofs of ability enough to earn the privilege. At the head of the institution is a director, who is changed every six years. He is usu¬ ally an artist of eminence; but his direction and super¬ vision are mainly nominal, and the young men are left to cultivate their genius pretty much in their own way. The rooms of the academy are thrown open to the is public in the month of April, when an exhibition made of the works of the pupils in painting and sculp¬ ture. Disinterested critics, who have attended these exhibitions, admit a general level of cleverness and cor¬ rectness in the performances, but feel a want of those vigorous individual traits which give to art its true vitality and power ; and they are constrained to con¬ fess that such works do not furnish a sufficient answer                                   "

This inquiry brings up the whole question as to the effect of academies upon art, which belongs to that numerous class of controversies in which much may be said on both sides,' and upon which high authorities are directly at issue. Between the Trinità de’ Monti and the promenade of the Monte Pincio, there is another object which déserves a moment’s pause. It is a fountain, not re¬ markable for size or beauty, being nothing more than a small, perpendicular jet of water, falling into an una¬ dorned, circular basin of stone : the whole overshadowed by a wide-spreading tree. But it is an attractive sight, not merely from its good proportions and unpretending simplicity, but from its fine position and its harmony with the objects around it. The view of St. Peter's. over its flowing and restless waters, though not set down in the guide-books, is well worth a long and patient look. The massive and silent bulk of the dis- tant dome is brought into vivid contrast with the danc¬ ing sparkle and silvery foam of the fountain, while the wide extent of the city and the Campagna, bathed the wide extent of the city and the Campagna, bathed in floods of rich light, seen from this quiet, shadowed nook, forms a picture not easily forgotten. The Monte Pincio itself is a space of only a few acres in extent, planted with trees and shrubbery, com¬ prising a circular drive for carriages, and rectangular walks for foot-passengers. There is nothing at all striking in the manner in which it is laid out ; and. indeed, the limited extent of surface forbids any at¬ tempt at the fine effects of landscape gardening.

There is probably no spot on earth from which the spectacle of sunset is seen to greater advantage than from the Monte Pincio, when we take into account the natural beauty of the panorama and the sacred light of association which hallows every object on which it falls.

The most con- spicuous object in it is an immense fountain the centre, which is one of the heaviest sins against good taste that ever was laid upon the much-enduring earth. In the midst of an immense circular basin huge blocks of stone are tumbled together, and so scooped, hollowed and indented as to represent the natural inequalities of the living rock. To these blocks are appended four the living rock. To these blocks are appended four colossal statues in marble, embodying four great rivers in the four different quarters of the globe ; the Danube, the Nile, the Ganges, and the La Plata. Below the statues, at opposite points of the circular basin, are a lion and a seahorse, also in marble. The whole is crowned by an obelisk of about fifty feet high, resting on a pedestal of about sixteen. The entire combina¬ tion is a cold and extravagant allegory, hardly inferior in absurdity to the monument to Dr. Arne, where he is represented playing on a harpsichord in the river Thames, with tritons and sea-nymphs sporting around him. Nor is there any special merit in the execution of the statues, to awaken a forgiving spirit towards the bad taste and want of simplicity in the design. Mod¬ elled by Bernini, and executed under his direction, they have the largest measure of his faults, redeemed by the smallest proportion of his peculiar merits. They are sprawling, grotesque, and monstrous ; with as little dignity about them as the giants of a travelling cara¬ van.

There are three other fountains in the Piazza, neither of which has any thing remarkable about it ; but the fact of there being four in a space of such limited extent, is worthy of mention as shewing the copious supply of water of mention as shewing the copious supply of water which Rome enjoys.

The Piazza also abounds with shops and stalls for the sale of all sorts of second-hand arti and stalls for the sale of all sorts of second-hand arti cles, and nowhere else have I ever seen such quantities of broken pottery, old iron, disabled household utensils. and all conceivable kinds of trash piled together; awakening wonder, at every step, that any one should ever buy such rubbish, or could put it to any use when bought.

Such are the different results of the wise lessons of commerce and the exterminating spirit of religious bigotry. Previous to the reign of Paul IV. who was made pope in May 1555, the position of the Jews in the Papal States was comparatively favorable. That dark and fervid bigot, whose character is drawn with so much life and vigor by Ranke, launched against this unhappy race, in the first year of his power, a merciless enact¬ ment. He forbad them to reside in any other place in the Papal States than Rome and Ancona, and in these the Papal States than Rome and Ancona, and in these cities they were restricted to a particular region. He compelled them to wear a visible badge of separation, which for men was a yellow hat, and for women a yellow veil or handkerchief. Jewish physicians were forbidden to prescribe for Christian patients, and Jewish families were not allowed to employ Christian servants, In their trades and occupations, the Jews weré also teased and injured by many arbitrary regulations. Since that time the Jews in Rome have been re- stricted to a particular quarter, which is called the Ghetto.

There are many shops, but usually of a humble class. The Jewish race is here seen in its saddest and lowest plight, not gilded by even a ray of its old glories. There is nothing that betokens the existence of wealth and the power that wealth bestows. There are no dignified forms : no keen and penetrating brows : none of those beautiful children who, in other lands, remind the Hebrews of the vouth of their nation: none of those superb black the vouth of their nation: none of those superb black eves which blend the passion of Judith, the softness of Esther, and the sadness of Rachel. The general countenance is commonplace : stamped with the im¬ press of sordid cares and homely occupations: touched by no sparkles of pride or hope. The complexion seems colorless — reminding one of plants that have grown in the dark — the result of meagre living, dark abodes, and imperfect ventilation.

The men, excluded from most attractive callings, are gen¬ erally petty shopkeepers, pedlers, and dealers in old clothes and second-hand articles. The women have great skill in mending and repairing garments, and in this craft their services are in requisition all over the city. Many of them give themselves to higher and finer kinds of needle-work. I have seen pieces of lace so rich and massive that they seemed rather to have been carved than wrought, which were the fruit of adventurous exploring expeditions into the Ghetto, and obtained at prices which were pronounced very cheap, but to my masculine judgment were nothing less than awful.

As they are compelled to live within certain limits, much extortion might be to live within certain limits, much extortion might be practised upon them in the way of rent, by short-sighted selfishness, were it not that this class of relations has been settled by a sort of customary law, which the tri- bunals respect, and by which the owners of houses are not allowed, except under extraordinary circumstances,                                  "

THE Campagna di Roma is the name of a region which nearly corresponds to the ancient Latium, ex¬ tending from the moûth of the Tiber to Terracina, and from the sea on the south-west to the lower ranges of the Apennines on the north-east. Its length is about the Apennines on the north-east. Its length is about sixty-two miles, and its greatest breadth about forty¬ five. In spite of its name, it is not wholly a plain; but is divided into two regions, the highlands and the lowlands. But the term Campagna is usually applied to the lowlands of the Tiber, which, strictly speaking, are known as l’Agro Romano, or the territory of the city of Rome, comprising about four hundred and fifty thousand acres. This region, the Campagna of tourists and of popu¬ lar speech, may be likened to a green and motionless sea, of which the Sabine and Volscian Hills are coasts, and in which the Alban Mount is an island. In spite and in which the Alban Mount is an island.

In its geological formation, it is deeply marked with the indications of that struggle between the elemental forces of fire and water which so many of the legends of the mythological period dimly shadow of the legends of the mythological period dimly shadow forth. Even to an uninstructed eye, it is obvious that this whole plain was once the bed of a deep sea, which washed the sides of the Sabine Hills, and when lashed by storms, threw its spray over the rocky summit of Monte Cavi, the highest point of the Alban Mount, Still, however, the Campagna is more of volcanic than of marine origin. While it yet lay deep under a waste of waters, it was the scene of a long series of volcanic of waters, it was the scene of a long series of volcanic struggles and convulsions which are traced to two cen- tral points or foci; one being upon the Alban Mount, and the other, at Monte Cimino, near Viterbo. The ashes and scoriæ discharged from these volcanic vents. disposed in layers over the marine deposits, and grad¬ ually consolidated by great pressure, now appear in the several varieties of piperino, so much used as a building material in the early structures of Rome, The land slowly rose: the fuel of the subterranean fires burnt out : and now another agency, that of fresh water, was introduced. The streams which drain the Apennines did not at first flow into the sea, but spread themselves out into lakes; remaining long enough to deposit not only strata of sand marl, but also those immense quarries of travertine, of which the finest buildings, as well as the most interesting ruins in Rome, are constructed.

Rome, peculiar in so many respects, is unlike all other European cities in the character of the region which lies immediately beyond its walls. Its suburbs are not gay with farms, gardens, country-houses, and villages. The solitude of a rural region is not reached by slow gradations, nor does the tide of population come imperceptibly to an end, like a spent wave that dies along a level beach. But as soon as the gates are passed, we come upon a far-reaching tract of monoto¬ nous desolation, in which every pulse of life seems to have ceased to beat. Far as the eye can pierce, it rests upon a plain of dreary and sombre verdure, which extends in every direction, and by the impressive mel¬ ancholy of its scenery, prepares the mind of the travel¬ ler to pass into the solemn shadow of Rome. This plain is that world-renowned Campagna, which is so in¬ separably connected with the ideal image of Rome- which is populous with so many visionary forms from the regions of history and poetry, vocal with so many voices of wisdom and warning, rich in the most solemn and teuching memories, and charms with such desolate and tragic beauty.

Though the inequalities of the surface in the Cam¬ pagna are inconsiderable, compared with its extent¬ though, when seen from a distance, they disappear to the eve, and are lost in a level expanse of verdure vet the region is not by any means an absolute plain, like that flat dreary table-land, for instance, in which Munich is situated. The traveller who explores it on foot or on horseback will find his path shortened, and his interest kept fresh by a constant undulation of sur- face, and by a succession of objects which, in their coloring and grouping, present ever-varying pictures. Sometimes the road abruptly descends into a hollow gorge or glen, where the view is excluded on nearly all sides by hills, and where only a glimpse can be had, through a single vista, of the snow-covered summits of the distant mountains; sometimes it passes over a breezy upland from which a wide prospect is com¬ manded; sometimes it winds along a lateral valley ; sometimes it is shouldered on either hand by precip- itous cliffs, which seem to have been torn apart by violence, and in their sheer sides of yellow travertine, crowned with foliage, offer those fine combinations of form and color which the artist loves to transfer to his sketch-book.

Of that life which takes root and is fixed per¬ manently to the soil, there is little or none in the Campagna. There are no cottages, with patches of garden-ground, and children sporting round the door\" no spacious farm-houses ; no sights and sounds of rural no spacious farm-houses ; no sights and sounds of rural toil. The figures which are indigenous to the soil are a few shepherds with cloaks of sheepskin, attended by a few shepherds with cloaks of sheepskin, attended by suspicious-looking dogs of dirty white, and, here and there, a mounted herdsman or overseer, armed with a long lance, whose locks and cloak stream back upon the wind as he rides, and whose figure, relieved against the distant sky, suggests that of a Bedouin Arab. But, in general, the living forms are only those which are in general, the living forms are only those which are connected, directly or indirectly, with the neighboring city — an artist with his sketch-book ; a fowler shoot¬ ing birds for the market ; a party of equestrians whose fresh complexions and firm seat betray their northern origin; a peasant from Velletri or Gensano driving a cart laden with wine-casks; a ponderous wain drawn by gray oxen ; a tumble-down and ague-stricken vet- tura, bound for Albano or Tivoli, crammed with life like the hold of a slave-ship ; and, occasionally, the smart barouche of an English millionaire or the heavy chocolate-colored coach of a cardinal, perhaps drawn up by the side of a road, while the owner, in his red stockings, is solemnly pacing up and down, taking exercise.

In the spring and early summer, it is gay with a luxuriant growth of wild flowers — among which the red poppy predominates, spreading a crim¬ son carpet over the landscape. The many kinds of flowering shrubs which grow here burst into bloom, so that the air is filled with penetrating odors, and the fresh turf is so strewed with blossoms that the foot can hardly be set down without crushing them. This the period at which the swarm of travellers are usually the period at which the swarm of travellers are usually leaving Rome and setting off upon their northern flight, so that few of those who pass the winter there ever see the Campagna in its vernal attire, of which those who have witnessed it speak with the most vivid pleasure. But this season of bridal splendor does not last long, for as the heats of summer come on, the Campagna lays aside its flowery mantle. In this re¬ gion the sleep of the year is more in the summer than the winter. The fierce heats of July and August have à paralyzing effect, like that of the frost and snows of a northern winter.

Then the rays of the vertical sun smite the earth like angry blows, the cloudless sky overhead seems a huge vault of glowing brass, and the ground is so hot that one almost expects to see his shadow curl up and disappear like a leaf thrown upon the fire. Then the flocks and herds are driven into the mountains, the buffaloes retreat to the swamps or immerse themselves in pools of water, and the few inhabitants who are compelled to remain on the spot seek a shelter in caves scooped out from the hill-sides, or in the spacious vaults of a Roman tomb.

The ground splits into rifts and chasms ; the roads are calcined into ashes ; and the grass is burnt to the color of hay. But the rains of the early autumn breathe new life into this fainting region, and wake it from its long summer’s siesta. A quick, luxuriant growth of grass springs up ; daisies and violets start from the turf; and the clematis blooms along the hedges. The flocks and herds return to their pasturage grounds; the labors of agriculture are resumed in the cultivated portions; and the Campagna puts on all the life that ever belongs to the Campagna puts on all the life that ever belongs to it. From this time until spring, its aspect does not materially change. Winter here is not the absolute night of the year — the negation and reverse side of warmth and bloom and verdure — but it is like the silvery twilight of a high northern latitude which pro- longs till midnight something of the glow of noon. At no period of the year could a botanist walk over the Campagna without gathering an ample and living har¬ vest from its abundant flora. The turf is green and fresh under the feet; the air is full of pleasant, earthy odors; in warm sunny days, the lizards dart along the hedges and around the margin of the ponds; the hedges and around the margin of the ponds; insects hum in the air; and in the morning, the lark springs from the dewy grass and sings at Heaven’s gate. The snow upon the tops of the distant moun¬ tains tells us that it is winter, but in the sunny and sheltered hollows it is often warm enough, even in January, to make the eye rest with pleasure upon their dazzling lines of cold.

The memorials of man, which stripe and dot the Campagna, are in harmony with the character of the scenery, and calculated to deepen the impression which its peculiar natural features make. The plain is a great historical palimpsest, from which the towns and cities of a subdued race have been expunged, in order to make room for the proud structures of a conquering people, which now, in their ruins, are no more than monuments of lost power and memorials of faded glory. The most striking objects upon it are the long lines of the Claudian and Marcian aqueducts, which stretch across the horizon for many a mile — whose arches, in various stages of decay, sometimes bare and sometimes mantled with climbing plants and veiled in verdure, blend a general resemblance with differences in detail. There are no structures of man’s hand which are woven so completely into the landscape as these aqueducts ; and the relation between them and the soil over which they stride, is so happy, that it the soil over which they stride, is so happy, that it probably furnished one reason, with a people so sensi¬ tive to impressions of form, for erecting them. Nothing breaks the monotony of a plain more agreeably to the eye than a succession of arches, high enough and of sufficient span to assume an imposing character when contemplated singly. How admirably the aqueducts of the Campagna are suited to the character of the scenery of which they form a part, may be appre- hended by imagining the far inferior effect they would produce if transported to the neighborhood of Florence, and how much of their present dignity would be lost if they were seen panting up those steep hills, and hurry- ing down those sheer valleys, constantly dwarfed and                                   "

But now they move along the floor of the Campagna as a stately procession moves through the piazza in front of St. Peter’s ; not lost in, but graced by the space in which they are contained. In all points of view they are beautiful and animating objects, whether we contemplate them as a whole, and follow with the eye the decreasing perspective of their arches, till in the far distance the level entablature seems to melt into the earth; or whether, standing apart, we mark the rounded portals of blue which each arch cuts out of the sky, and thus set the landscape in successive frames. Just in proportion as these aqueducts have lost in usefulness, they have gained in beauty. The hand of time and the mace of violence — which have broken their formal lines and shattered the smooth ring of their arches, which have made nooks and hollows for grass and wild flowers and running vines to take root in — have substituted variety for uniformity, and added that peculiar charm of the picturesque, which makes an old mill or a ruined bridge more attractive to painters than when in a perfect state. THE APPIAN WAY. The best known of the Roman roads, the Appian Way, stretches across the Campagna from the Porta San Sebastiano, and since the draining of the Pontine Marshes by Pius VI. forms the most travelled route be¬ tween Rome and Naples.

Such roads could not have been constructed, unless the very workmen who wrought upon them had been impressed with the idea of the eternal duration of Rome. The road, on either hand, is bordered by tombs in various stages of décay, some mere masses of shapeless brick-work, overgrown with ivy and other climbing plants, most of them without name or inscription, but some identified by the investigations of antiquaries. They are of va¬ rious forms, some round, some square, and some pyra- midal. Some, of larger size and higher pretensions than common, shew remains of architectural elevations. with pediments, columns, or pilasters.

Here the fervid and vig¬ orous animal life of Rome put forth its trained energies, perhaps all the more earnestly from the silent admoni¬ tion of that sepulchral tower, recalling the dark presence whose touch was destined to stiffen into clods those elastic and obedient muscles. It was not of the largest size although it held eighteen thousand spectators — but it is valued by the students of the past, from the fact of its still preserving traces, more or less distinct, of all the various parts of which a circus was composed.

We know that these names and these events are but shadows, like the ac¬ tors and revels with which Prospero entertained his guests before he had doffed his magic robes, but we may apply to the legendary history of early Rome that strain of argument, not more beautiful than true, with which Max Piccolomini justifies and explains the astro¬ logical pursuits of Wallenstein.

The ruins themselves have little either of beauty or expression. They consist of two principal structures, both built of brick ; one, round and tapering like a light- house, the other, octagonal. They are near together, and have a sort of family likeness. There are, in each, niches hollowed in the walls, and rounded aper¬ tures for the admission of light. The purpose and meaning of these buildings are not distinctly known. The ground in their immediate neighborhood is thickly strewn with smaller fragments.

WALKS IN THE CAMPAGNA. Some of my most agreeable recollections of Rome are associated with long walks over the Campagna, sometimes extending through a large part of the day, especially towards the end of winter and the beginning- of spring. At this season, in sunny weather, there is a mixture of softness and elasticity in the air of Rome which makes exercise agreeable, and prevents it from being exhausting ; nor is there any fear of an east wind’s setting in to blight the heated frame with deadly chills. Then the Campagna opens wide its arms of invitation, and offers the freshest of turf, the brightest of skies, and the gentlest of airs ; and it is indeed ' sullen- ness against nature ’ to resist the call. There is always variety enough to supply the senses with perpetual in- terest, and keep the powers of observation in a state of healthy activity, so that if weariness comes, it comes unawares.

We have no right to look upon a landscape only as a pic¬ ture, or to view it merely as a harvest-field for dreamy emotions or fine visions. When from any elevated point we survey a wide-extended tract of country, the considerations which are first in importance are those growing out of the relation of humanity to the soil on which we gaze. Who are the men that till these broad plains, these sunny hill-sides, and these shaded valleys? For whom are those golden harvests waving, and into whose laps will these ripening fruits fall?

Has some enormous capi¬ talist spread his title-deeds over the whole horizon, or is the soil divided into modest proprietorships, so or is the soil divided into modest proprietorships, so that the heart of the owner may pass into the sod which he tills, and love lighten the burden of labor? To overlook all these relations, to surrender ourselves, without question or protest, to the magic of lovely scenery, in spite of the shadow of human suffering which may rest upon it, is to admire the plumage and forget the dying bird.' Bonstetten says, that if the statue of Rome which surmounts the tower of the Capitol had human sympa¬ thies and could feel its position, its lot would have been most pitiable and forlorn, doomed as it has been, for so many centuries, to survey the dreary waste which on all sides surrounds the walls of the imperial city. Lhave before remarked upon the depopulation of the Campagna — how bare it is of permanent habitations — how its waste regions never ring with the cheerful sounds of human industry — and how a shroud of death- like silence seems extended over its hills and valleys.

Within a circle of the radius of five miles drawn from the State-House as a centre, the humber of inhabitants outside of Boston will be found to be not much less than that of those within. How infinitely complicated and extensive are the relations between the city and its suburbs, may be fully felt by any one who will stand for an hour upon one of our bridges, either at the beginning or the close of the day — or watch the coming and going of the early and late railway trains. It is a system of mutual help and mutual dependence. There are many branches of business in the city, the prosperity and even exist¬ ence of which rest upon the support drawn from the country; and multitudes of men and women whose bread is derived from the same source. The city is a centre of distribution, from which innumerable radii diverge in every direction. It is a network of relation, with lateral and convergent threads crossing and re- crossing each other, and forming an organic whole sensitive in every part. We may imagine, but we can hardly calculate, the desolation and blight which would fall upon Boston, were that flourishing belt of towns and villages with which it is now girded, suddenly swept away from the face of the landscape, and the whole range of country visible from the top of the State-House wore the dreary monotony of the flat marshes between Chelsea and Lynn.

It was not always so. In the early periods of Ro¬ man history the whole Campagna swarmed with life, and was the seat of numerous independent communi¬ ties, who cultivated their several parcels of soil with industry, and defended them with valor. Rome was nearly four hundred years in subduing these little com¬ monwealths, and succeeded only by the exercise of indomitable courage and the most obstinate perse¬ verance. The struggle with Veii in particular, the site of which was only ten miles distant, was a struggle of life and death; and it cost a siege of ten years to of life and death; and it cost a siege of ten years to put down a city the walls of which, in a clear day, could be seen from the Capitol.

The con- quest of the world was comparatively easy, after that of Latium had been achieved. But the depopulation of the Campagna was not the immediate result of its of the Campagna was not the immediate result of its passing into the possession of Rome; for it was the policy of the Romans to mingle their own blood with that of the communities which they conquered, taking part of their lands, opening a vent to their own redun- dant population, and thus at once extending and con¬ solidating their empire. The evil which now broods over the Campagna rests upon it with the accumulated weight of centuries. The causes of its gradual depopulation are kindred with those which led to the decline and fall of the Ro¬ man empire itself. They are to be found in that grasping spirit of the favored classes against which so many agrarian laws were directed; in the power of property to attract property ; and in the prevalence of a system by which enormous estates were gathered a system by which enormous estates were gathered into a few hands, while the mass of the commuuity was doomed to a depth of poverty which was fatal to was doomed to a depth of poverty which was fatal to virtue, because fatal to hope.

These evils increased with the de- clining fortunes of the Western empire, and when the successive hordes of Northern invaders laid waste the Campagna, and blotted out whatever of life yet clung to the soil, they only completed a work of destruction which had long been going on. The history of the Campagna during the middle ages is but a record of the disasters and devastations of the city itself, only in more abundant measure; for while Rome was protected by its walls, the Campagna had no shelter against the storms of war. It was a perpetual field of battle, witnessing the last struggles of the Roman empire against its foreign invaders, and at a later period, the civil contests of the powerful feu¬ at a later period, the civil contests of the powerful feu¬ dal barons with each other.

Nor has it since been waked into life; but it still presents essentially the same fea¬ tures and has the same character as when the Colonna and Orsini fought together on its plains, and the youth- and Orsini fought together on its plains, and the youth- ful Rienzi mused amid its ruins, and found a motive for generous effort in that dreary solitude from which for generous effort in that dreary solitude from which the inspiration of his impassioned eloquence was drawn.

As to the mere aggregate of wealth annually added to the sum total of the capital of a country, the solution is not without difficulty ; but when we take into account the element of social happiness, the amount of moral and material well-being, which each system respectively creates and sustains, the inquiry becomes still more embarrassing and complicated. A large landed pro- prietor, whose estate is cut up into farms of moderate extent and tilled by tenants who hold leases and pay rents, sits down in his study and calculates, that by expelling these tenants and their families, converting his whole domain into an immense sheep-farm, he can add ten per cent. to his income; and he feels that the question is settled as to him, and takes his measures accordingly. But what would be the effect upon the community at large, were such a change to become frequent or extensive ? a change — by which great numbers of families are uprooted from the soil they cultivated, which, in its turn, helped to cultivate in them the social and domestic virtues — which compels them to choose between emigration or a descent in the social scale, and fills their places with day-laborers bound neither to the land nor its owner by any ties but those of self-interest.

As to the subdivision of land, the Campagna of Rome and the greater part of France stand at the opposite extremes of the scale; and the experience of both confirms the judgment that in this, as in most things, there is a point at which the greatest amount of good and the smallest measure of evil are blended: and that this point is to be sought by observation and not established by a priori reasoning. In France the number of separate proprietaries is about eleven mil- lion, and that of separate proprietors about six million. The disastrous effects of this minute subdivision upon the productive resources of France and the hardly less the productive resources of France and the hardly less malign influence it has exerted upon its politics, are obvious to any candid observer who has watched the course of events in that country since the general peace of Europe in 1815. In the Campagna of Rome we see the injurious results of the opposite extreme. The Agro Romano, or territory of Rome, so called, according to the survey of Nicolai, contains eleven thousand four hundred rubbii, the rubbio being about four acres. This territory belongs to one hun- dred and seventy-seven proprietors, of whom one hun- dred and thirteen are individuals, and sixty-four are corporations. Of the individual proprietors the largest is the Prince Borghese, who owns nearly fifty thousand acres. The largest proprietors among the corporations are, the chapter of St. Peter’s, which own about forty- five thousand acres, and the hospital of Santo Spirito,                                  "

The number of which has about thirty-two thousand. separate ’farms is four hundred and seventeen, of which seventeen are of more than two thousand acres each. The estate of Campo Morto — which lies be- yond the limits of the Agro Romano, about thirty miles from Rome, but still within the Campagna, properly so called — is the largest in the Papal States, being about twenty thousand acres in extent. It belongs to the chapter of St. Peter’s. These estates, immense as they are, are not managed by the owners themselves on their own account, but a further process of aggrega¬ tion takes place through a system, by which the Agro Romano, and indeed much of the Campagna which lies beyond it, are let to a powerful body of middle-men, called Mercanti di Campagna, merchants of the Cam- pagna. They are about fifty in number, residing in Rome and forming a sort of corporation ; and, as such, recognized and protected by the papal government. The enterprise which they undertake requires a great amount of capital, as may be inferred from the fact that the estate of Campo Morto pays an annual rent of five thousand pounds. As these merchants reside in the same place and collectively wield a vast amount of cap¬ ital, and as their interests are absolutely identical, it may well be conceived that by a concert of action, and by a skilful combination of their powers and resources, they may exert an unnatural influence upon the price of agricultural products, like that of a conspiracy of brokers upon the market value of some particular stock. From the magnitude of their operations, their establish- ments in Rome are like the counting-rooms and ware¬ houses of extensive merchants ; and there is probably                                   "

They are permanently attached to their posts of duty, and have inducements to earn a character for industry and fidelity, and to make their own interests identical with those of their employers. Their wages are tolerably good, and when the toils of the day are over they find a place of shelter and repose which, in some imperfect measure, represents a home. The lot of the purely agricultural laborers is not so fortunate. As I have before remarked, the raising of cattle is a more lucrative occupation in the Campagna than the tilling of the soil, and it is consequently the object to¬ wards which the capital and energies of the mercanti                                  "

Of the arable land, there is probably not more than one-tenth under cultivation at any one time, although the soil is very fertile, and especially adapted to the cereal grains. Wheat, the principal crop, is sown once in three or four years; the land, in the intermediate years, according to its the land, in the intermediate years, according to its quality, lying fallow, or producing Indian corn, oats, or beans. There is no system of manuring and the soil is left to its own unaided energies. The proportion of land actually under cultivation, moderate as it is, would be still less, were it not that the ground must be broken be still less, were it not that the ground must be broken up and laid down to tillage once in a few years, in or¬ der to produce grass in the abundance and of such a quality as the necessities of pasturage require. We will suppose that the manager of one of these large farms proposes to break up a tract of pas¬ ture land, which has been lying fallow for two or three seasons, and lay it down in wheat. In this interval, the vivid energies of a rich volcanic soil have covered it with a rank growth of sturdy shrubs, which must first it with a rank growth of sturdy shrubs, which must first be cut down with hatchets and rooted up with pickaxes. Then it is ploughed carefully and repeatedly, and the seed grain is dropped into the furrows, and the plough again passes over the tract, in order to cover the seed with earth. Then succeeds the process of breaking up the clods, pulling up the roots of such weeds as still the clods, pulling up the roots of such weeds as still remain, and giving to the furrows a regular form. The young plants, as they appear above the ground, are weeded and hoed, and the ground is kept loose about their roots. These duties extend from October to April or May, and are very severe, employing a great num¬ ber of laborers who are hired by the season or by the                                   "

They are engaged not singly but in troops or compa¬ nies comprising whole families, the bargain being made with a corporale or head man, under whose charge they move to the scene of their labors like a gipsy settlement or an Arab encampment. Here they find no perma¬ nent and substantial places of shelter, but must live in tents or rude huts of reeds and branches of trees. Sometimes, however, they find a sleeping-place in the buildings of the casale, in which case they are com¬ pelled to walk three or four miles after the toils of the day, and the same distance in the morning before they begin. Their food is meagre and poor and they are imperfectly clad, so that they can offer but feeble resistance to the fatal influences of the climate, being often exposed to days of great heat, and damp and chilly nights, and thus sickness and death make sad havoc among them, and fill the hospitals of Rome from their numbers. M. de Tournon mentions it as an hon- orable trait in the noble and pious family of Pamphili¬ orable trait in the  noble and pious family of Pamphili¬ Doria,' that upon each of their estates they employ a vehicle for the transportation of their sick laborers to the nearest hospital. Between the last of these preliminary labors and the harvest, which usually occurs about the middle of June, there is an interval of only a few weeks. During the season of harvest, the Campagna puts on an unusual expression of animation and life. As the grain ripens over great tracts, belonging to different proprietors, the element of time becomes very important, and it is es¬ sential that a considerable number of supernumerary laborers should be under command during that limited                                  "

Then the chill winds and heavy dews which so often succeed the burning heats of the sun fall upon them with silent, deadly power, and the poison of fever passes into their veins. Each day the number of the healthy and able- bodied is diminished, and when their task is done and they have received their wages, many have no more strength than enables them to crawl home and die at their own doors. Such are the conditions upon which the Campagna is cultivated, and so little regard is paid to the life and is cultivated, and so little regard is paid to the life and bealth of the forlorn laborers by whom its golden har- vests are sown and reaped.

The beauty of the Cam¬ pagna, to the eye of humanity, is turned to ashes ; and to its ear, the breezes which sweep over it seem laden with the sighs of the sick and the groans of the dying. The deep-hearted Sismondi has written upon this sub- ject in a strain of generous sympathy, and with a full sense of the wrong which man has here done to man.

From the same sources may be derived the means of correcting one or two of the impressions usually left upon the minds of superficial observers, who record the obser- vations of a hurried visit to Rome, and especially of qualifying that sweeping censure which Protestant travellers are apt to pass upon the Papal government.

The Papal government, though liable to many objections, is not the worst in Europe; and the men who administer it are, as a general rule, not inferior in intelligence to the statesmen of other Catholic coun¬ tries, and probably superior in purity of life. The Catholic Church is eminently democratic in principle, opening freely the path to its highest honors to talent, learning, and worth; and although family influence doubtless exerts here, as every where else, an unques¬ tioned power, yet there are always many men in the college of Cardinals who have risen to that high posi¬ tion, solely by personal merit.

But they have encountered a steady opposition from the proprietors and lessees, who, taking a mate. rial and selfish view of the subject, and starting from the position that land is dormant or inactive capital. contend that they have a right to draw from it the largest amount of return which, with the aid of active capital, it can be made to yield; and that when they have shewn that pasturage is more lucrative than til¬ lage, they have met all the elements in the case. The gist of the controversy is contained in a statistical cal¬ culation presented to the government by the proprietors in 1790, and afterwards restated in 1800. By this it in 1790, and afterwards restated in 1800. By this it appeared that a capital of eight thousand crowns, invested in the cultivation of wheat, vielded a net re¬ turn of only thirty crowns; while the same capital invested in a flock of sheep, brought a return of nine- teen hundred and seventy-two crowns. This was esteemed an unanswerable and decisive argument in favor of the superior advantages of pasturage. But, as Sismondi observes, this comparison is not betwéen two tracts of land of equal extent, but between two équal sums of money devoted, one to pasturage and the other to tillage: and it virtually involves a begging the other to tillage: and it virtually involves a begging of the question.

It is thus an extrav- agant waste of land, and a reduction of the number of those deriving support from land to the smallest amount. What is the net return derived from the flocks and herds that roam over the unpeopled tract, to the aggregate wealth that might be drawn from the soil, were the population at the rate of two hundred to the square mile, as in the other parts of the pontifi¬ cal states ? Thus the state suffers by the absence or non-existence of all those persons whom this mode of using the land prevents from inhabiting it. It is not in the neighborhood of Rome alone that this process is going on, and that an enlightened and humane spirit is putting its veto upon changes sanctioned by that polit¬ ical economy which tells us that it makes no difference whether a great proprietor spends his income upon the estate from which it is derived, or in a distant capital. The conversion in Scotland of arable land into sheep- walks and deer-forests, by which whole hamlets of colters and small farmers were swept from the soil, is of the same kind, and no calculations of a heart¬ less science can ever reconcile humanity to such changes.“ * Campo Morto, one of the estates belonging to the patri¬ mony of St. Peter’s, lying between here, (Gensano) and the lake, is let to a farmer.

The same evils that provoked attention in times less humane and less enlightened than our own, still present themselves to the more experienced mind and more susceptible heart of to-day. There is the same dreary depopulation, the same deadly malaria, the same frightful waste of hu- same deadly malaria, the same frightful waste of hu- man life.

The events which have taken place since the date of its publication, do not, however, tend to make the desired consummation more probable. We meet upon the threshold this inexorable dilemma; the Campagna cannot become healthy till it is more thickly peopled ; and it cannot be more thickly peopled till it peopled ; and it cannot be more thickly peopled till it becomes more healthy. To overcome this difficulty: to solve this problem — would require a concentration of powers and a command of means, such as the ordi¬ of powers and a command of means, such as the ordi¬ nary flow of events can never call forth.

Were these it as the capital of Catholic Christendom. Were these sources cut off, a considerable part of its population must either starve or move to some other place.

There was so much work for the eye to do —there was such an amount of form, light, and color dashed upon the canvas of the horizon — that in the whirl of impressions, there was neither time nor patience to rest upon details. The whole route was much infested by that ravenous brood of animals that feed upon trunks and passports. I will not attempt to record how many times we fell into their devouring jaws: nor how great was the sum of delay and vexation occasioned by them — nor what was the aggregate of tribute they levied upon us — but will only enjoin it upon those who may hereafter have occasion to jour- ney on that route, to fortify their souls with patience, and their pockets with pauls.

There is not a church or a palace or a public building of any kind, of such conspicuous merit that one need regret not to have seen it. Why this city¬ more than double the size of any other in Italy- should languish in such architectural poverty, is a mys¬ tery not easily explained. All the works of art of any consequence, are to be found in the Museum ; and the great attraction of this collection is not in its pictures or marble statues, which seem but crumbs fallen from the tables of Rome and Florence, but in its unique relics from Herculaneum and Pompeii. It cannot be denied, that after the excitement and exhaustion of Florence and Rome, it is a relief to find ourselves in a place where there are no churches to visit, no picture¬ galleries to go through, no palaces and villas that must be examined — where no inexorable Nemesis chases us with a guide-book in one hand a watch in the other — where we may, without self-reproach, surren- der ourselves to unforeseen impulses, and not rise in the morning with a duty, in the disguise of a pleasure, the morning with a duty, in the disguise of a pleasure, set against every hour in the day.

The curve of the gulf lying between them is not regular, but the line of the coast makes nearly a right angle at Naples and also at Castellamare ; the intervening space being nearly straight. Vesuvius occupies a point about half way between the projecting points. The whole space is crowded with human life, and comprises within itself nearly every form of beau- ty into which earth and water can be moulded. On one side, from a liquid plain of the most dazzling blue, a range of mountains, the peaks of which are for many months covered with snow, rise into the air. Forests of oak and chestnut encircle them midway. Between them and the sea there is hardly a terrace of level land, and the cliffs that line that tideless shore are often crowned and draped with luxuriant vegeta- tion. In another direction, the primitive features are less grand ; but the action of volcanic agencies has given great variety of surface within a small compass. Numberless points are crowned with villas, monasteries, and houses, linked together by a glowing succession of orange groves, vineyards, orchards, and gardens. Over all the unrivalled scene, Vesuvius towers and reigns; all the unrivalled scene, Vesuvius towers and reigns; forming the point of convergence in which all the lines of beauty and grandeur meet.

But when to this merely lineal beauty, we add the mysterious and awful power of which its smoke and fire are symbols, and those fearful energies of destruction which the imagination magnifies at will, it becomes a feature in the landscape, which, considering its position and prox- imities, has no parallel on the globe. It would seem as if volcanic agency were necessary to crown the earth with its most impressive loveliness and grandeur, just as a human face never reveals all its beauty till passion burns in the eye and trembles on the lip. The action of fire alone heaves up those sheer walls and notched battlements of rock, and sets the mountain lake in those deep and wooded sockets, by which the most expressive landscapes are formed, and through which great effects are produced without the aid of great space. Water shapes and smooths the earth into some- thing like a Grecian regularity of outline, but fire sharpens and points it after Gothic types. The whole line of coast from Pozzuoli to Sorrento repeats and renews the same curves and wayes of beauty. The land is rounded, scooped, and hollowed; holding out jutting promontories and projections, like arms of invitation, to the sea. No rigid lines of de¬ fence are thrown up; no castellated masses of granite stand along the coast like line-of-battle ships drawn up for an engagement; no where is an expression of de- fance stamped upon the scene.

In both, the town, the buildings, the work of man’s hands, are the town, the buildings, the work of man’s hands, are subordinate to the grand commanding features of nature around and above them.

Naples is not only stretched along a winding coast, but scattered over the terraces and spurs of à range of semicircular hills ; and is brought into imme¬ diate proximity with commanding heights and a grand expanse of water. Thus, when it is seen from the sea — which is the finest point of view — the magnifi¬ cent lines and sweeps of the landscape fairly eat up the city itself ; and its white buildings look like rows of China cups and saucers ranged along the shelves of a crescent-shaped closet.

A large part of all that we know of the private life of the Romans has been revealed to us from these opened graves of the past. It is a curious fact, that we owe the preservation of these most impressive and instructive memorials to means and causes which, of all others, would seem the least likely to accomplish such a result. It is difficult to conceive of a more destructive agency than that put forth by the eruption of a volcano ; nor is there any wrath so consuming as the wrath of fire ; and yet, in wrath so consuming as the wrath of fire ; and yet, in this instance, their spell has been reversed, and they have sheltered from decay, and restored unharmed, a world of objects which air and light would long ago have destroyed.

Upon what may be called the sentimental side of the ques¬ tion, — that side upon which Lord Byron looked at the transportation of the Elgin marbles to London,— there is no doubt that much may be urged in support of this view. But Herculaneum is shrouded in the deepest night, so that nothing can be seen beyond the small circle of light shed by the torches; and at Pompeii it would have been necessary to maintain an army of keepers and guardians to protect the treasures there found from the rapacity of travellers. Upon the whole, therefore, we must be content with the arrange- ment as we find it, and not let what might be cast a shadow upon what is.

The most graceful forms of animal and vegetable life were imitated and reproduced in their ornaments, — such as the claws of lions and griffins, the legs of goats, the branches of trees, the stems and flowers of liliaceous plants, — and these are ingeniously combined with minute architectural details, bas-reliefs, and heroic or mythological forms. It is the same with the vessels of metal destined for the homely offices of life.

This mosaic had been injured by an earthquake with which Pompeii was visited some years before its destruction, and the repairs it underwent in consequence are de- tected by the inferior character of the workmanship.

In one room is gathered together a little congress of Venuses, and the visitor may study and compare all those modifications of beauty and grace, which the ingenuity of ancient artists contrived to throw around their conceptions of the goddess of love and smiles; and mark the essential character of the figure combined with unconsciousness, with playfulness, with coquetry, with unconsciousness, with playfulness, with coquetry, and with wantonness. The colossal Hercules of Glycon is overloaded with masses of muscle ; and this exaggeration of animal power and the small size of the head make the statue look too much like an overgrown gladiator, and not the duty-obeyirg demigod, whose heroic strength was ever governed by heroic sentiments.

Here is a striking statue of Apollo, in porphyry ; of a size larger than life ; represented in a sitting posture, holding a lyre in his hand — the lyre and the extremi¬ ties of the figure being in Carrara marble. The dra- pery, in spite of the hardness of the material, is wrought with infinite patience and skill, and hangs in such deli¬ cate folds that it looks as if the breath of summer would move them. There is also a Meleager, in rosso antico; two barbarians, in pavonazzetto, in a kneeling posture, and supporting an entablature; an Egyptian priest, in basalt ; and a very fantastic statue of Diana, in oriental alabaster and bronze, looking like a macoronic poem in two languages. The Egyptian Museum contains the usual assortment of articles found in such collections ; vases, figures in bronze and terra cotta, sarcophagi, and ghastly-grin- ning mummies — by no means a cheerful company. To pass from a hall illumined by the light of Greek genius, into one of these grim and dingy Egyptian mu¬ seums, is like going from a garden to a cellar. A spacious and well-lighted room is dedicated to the patient labors of the scholars who occupy themselves with unrolling and deciphering the rolls of papyri which have been discovered at Herculaneum and Pom- peii. Some large cases contain a quantity of the rolls as they are found; looking like small cylinders of charred wood, and so little like what they really are, that when first brought to light, large quantities were destroyed by the workmen in mere wantonness.

Infinité patience is requisite in the process, as a single rash pull at the capstan may the process, as a single rash pull at the capstan may undo the work of days. Some of those which have been most successfully unrolled are ranged round the room in glass cases. By an inexperienced eye, the letters can be just traced by a rather stronger line of black. In an inner room are the books which have been published. It is melancholy to reflect, that after all the expense of time and money given to this pursuit of knowledge, nothing of the least value has been of knowledge, nothing of the least value has been brought to light. The picture gallery contains a number of indifferent works and a few good ones. Among the latter are: A Holy Family by Raphael, called * Madonna col divino Amore,' in which the Child, seated on the lap of the Virgin, is blessing the Baptist, who kneels before the Virgin, is blessing the Baptist, who kneels before him on one knee, holding a cross in his hand. Eliza- beth supports the arm of the Child which gives the benediction. Joseph is standing in the background. There is much in this picture which is characteristic of Raphael, but the action of the Child seems hardly of Raphael, but the action of the Child seems hardly consistent with his age, and too much like a dramatic performance. The Madonna della Gatta, so called from a cat which crouches in one corner, is by Julio Romano, from Raphael’s design; a refined and beautiful con¬ ception, interpreted by a coarser hand. The marriage of St. Catharine, by Correggio— a subject often repeated by him — is a very beautiful picture, so far as the human element involved in the                                  "

The smiling and arch surprise with which the child looks up into his mother’s face is full of the peculiar charm of this fascinating painter. By the same artist is the Madonna della Zingarella, in which the Virgin is resting with the Child, during in which the Virgin is resting with the Child, during the flight into Egypt — a pleasing and expressive work. By Titian, are a very noble portrait of Philip II. of Spain; a Magdalen, and a Danae, both splendid speci¬ mens of coloring, but neither of them remarkable for refinement of feeling or elevated expression. The 'Carita,' by Schedone, is a very striking work -à little melo-dramatic in its general tone, and with an atmosphere of exaggeration hanging over it, but an atmosphere of exaggeration hanging over it, but full of vivid power and animated life. It breaks upon the eye, like a burst of military music upon the ear, the eye, like a burst of military music upon the ear, and it is quite difficult to turn away from it and look and it is quite difficult to turn away from it and look at any thing else.

The buried city lies about thirteen miles from Naples, and is now approach- ed by a railway, which passes through Portici, Torre del Greco and Torre dell’ Annunziata. A railway to del Greco and Torre dell’ Annunziata. A railway to Pompeii! There was infinite matter for reflection in this contrast of ideas. One of the most wonderful results of modern civilization brought into immediate relation with the most striking monument of the arts and life of the past! To me, there was nothing dis- cordant in a combination which disturbs the sensibili- ties of many. It seemed appropriate to be transported from the living and smiling present to the heart of the dead past, by the swiftest and most powerful wings that modern invention has furnished. The situation of Pompeii must have been beautiful. It was built upon à gently swelling elevation ; the base of which was a bed of lava, the product of some errup- of which was a bed of lava, the product of some errup- tion of Vesuvius long anterior to the earliest historical                      "

The loveliest of seas spread its ample bosom in full view of the inhabitants — its cooling breezes in full view of the inhabitants — its cooling breezes sweeping over the town without any intervening object to break their power. Vesuvius was about five miles distant; and after a sleep of many centuries, its sides were covered with gardens and vineyards, its broken summit crowned with forests of oak and chestnut. It was then an object of beauty and grandeur, and a bounteous source of corn and wine : not, as now, a mere shape of awful and unmeasured terror; ever watched with uneasy glances, like a sleeping lion or a rising thunder-cloud. A navigable river, the Sarnus, flowed through the city in a clear and rapid current, Blessed with these natural advantages, living under a delicious climate, upon a thickly-peopled coast most strongly stamped with the luxury of Rome, the inhabit- ants of Pompeii might well have felt that the lines had fallen to them in pleasant places. The first aspect of the resuscitated city did not cor¬ respond exactly to my expectations. It looked some¬ what like a square in a modern city which had been partially destroyed by a conflagration. All the exca¬ vated rubbish had been removed, and there was noth- ing to prove that it had been so long buried under a shroud of earth. When we reach the end of the exca- vated portion, and are stopped by a sheer wall of gray ashes, of some eighteen feet high, with trees and vines growing upon it, we begin to comprehend the unique character of the place. As is well known, the utmost wrath of the volcano was not let loose upon Pompeii. It was not destroved was not let loose upon Pompeii. It was not destroved by streams of lava, but by showers of cinders mixed, by streams of lava, but by showers of cinders mixed,                                  "

The ruin effected by the first eruption was by no means complete, and by the first eruption was by no means complete, and there are indubitable proofs that the inhabitants re- turned and carried off many of their valuables.

Six¬ teen vears before that event, it had been desolated by an earthquake — the first premonitory symptom of the reviving terrors of the long-slumbering Vesuvius and many indications of the destruction occasioned by this disaster are visible among the ruins.

I will therefore confine myself, substantially, to such general impressions as were gathered from an examin- ation of a few hours. When we begin to look about us, we are immedi- ately struck with the extreme narrowness of the streets. which finds no parallel in any modern city of Europe, unless it be Venice. It is, indeed, a city not of streets but of lanes and alleys. Many of these are so narrow that à man can step from one curb-stone to the other; and where they are wider, a raised stepping-stone has been placed in the centre of the crossing, so that no more than two strides are required to pass from one side to the other. Of course, the vehicles adapted to such streets must have been of proportionate dimensions between the wheels ; and as each one must have occu¬ pied the whole space between the curb-stones, we are left without any means of conjecturing what expedients were resorted to, or what police regulations were in were resorted to, or what police regulations were in force, when two carriages, moving in different direc- tions, met each other. The streets are very well payed with large, irregular blocks of lava, in which the ruts worn by the chariot wheels are distinctly discernible. Many private houses and villas have been excavated in Pompeii, differing from each other in elegance and in Pompeii, differing from each other in elegance and extent, as their owners were men of wealth, compe- tence, or poverty ; but still with a certain family like¬ ness among them all.

The causes of this difference are to be found. partly in the dissimilar requisitions of a hot and a cold climate, and partly in unlike habits, tastes, and ways of living. In a northern climate, the necessity of using artificial heat for many months in the year is the controlling element in domestic architecture ; but in southern Italy houses were and are built with special reference to the warmth of the sun in winter, and an abundance of fresh air in summer. We must have compactness; but they required extension. A fine house in Pompeii consists of several enclosed spaces, some open to the sky, around which walls and colonnades are built. These communicate with each other by doors and passages. The atrium — which is the principal room entered after the vestibule — is a large and often elegantly decorated apartment, with a square or rectangular opening in the roof, which has a pitch towards the centre; and under this opening is a sunken cistern, called a compluvium, into which the rain-water drips. Around this apart- ment, or hall — like state-rooms around a cabin —are ranged the sleeping rooms ; little, dark, narrow, con- fined holes, without windows ; and receiving light and air only through the door opening into the atrium — without any of the comforts and conveniences of a modern bedroom ; and often containg only a rude modern bedroom ; and often containing only a rude bench, rather than bedstead, on which the sleeper 9 VOL.

In small houses, occupied by persons of modest for¬ tune and inferior position, the atrium and its appendages made up the whole of the residence ; but where the owner was a man of fortune and consequence, the atrium was used as a sort of public hall, or reception¬ room, and the family resided in inner suites of apart¬ ments. But the same primitive type of construction was repeated throughout. Sometimes the space devot¬ ed to the compluvium in the atrium, was, in the inner halls, occupied by a small garden, or rather bed of earth, in which shrubs and flowers were planted. There are many of these baby-gardens at Pompeii, some not bigger than a hearth-rug. In the more im- posing houses, the women of the family resided in a quarter exclusively appropriated to their use. When we compare a Roman house in Pompeii with the houses in a New England town of the same class, the houses in a New England town of the same class, we readily see a marked difference in the tastes, habits, and employments of their respective inhabitants. In general, in a New England house, the entry or hall is not conspicuous for size or ornament ; whereas in à Roman house, the atrium — which corresponds some- what to the spacious hall of an old-fashioned country¬ house — is the prominent portion, upon which the wealth and taste of the proprietor are most displayed; and a stranger who had penetrated so far would form an accurate notion of the extent and character of the an accurate notion of the extent and character of the whole mansion.

In nothing are the advantages en¬ the public post. In nothing are the advantages en¬ joyed by the women of our time, as compared with their Roman sisters, more conspicuous than in this matter of letter-writing. In Rome, the privilege of writing and receiving letters was reserved to a select few — to men of fortune, of high rank, or conspicuous station — and to the greater part of the female sex it was an unknown luxury. In this department, modern literature owes much to the delicate and graceful genius of woman; but in this she has done no more than pay a debt of gratitude for a privilege which has con- tributed so much to her intellectual development and happiness. A Roman house was constructed for general con- venience, and not for the special tastes and exclusive accommodation of individuals composing the family, They lived together in the atrium or some correspond- ing apartment; seeking the sunny side or gathering round a brazier in winter, and in the summer, drawing a linen shade over the roof, and opening all the doors a linen shade over the roof, and opening all the doors for the free circulation of air.

The ancient inhabitant of Pompeii, when he felt an exposition of sleep, asked only for a place to lie down upon — like a Neapolitan beggar on a fine summer’s night. His dressing-room was at the a fine summer’s night. His dressing-room was at the public baths, and there all the operations of the toilet were performed. In decorations and embellishments, the difference is that in Pompeii they are seen in the houses themselves, but with us, in the appurtenances and appendages. We hang pictures and engravings upon the walls, but they painted the walls themselves. We spread costly car¬ pets upon the floors ; they trod upon marble slabs often inwrought with mosaics. We shade our windows with rich curtains; they dispensed with windows altogether. Most of the houses brought to light in Pompeii are small, and there must have been a good deal of packing and stowing to accommodate large families. As what may be called the common or public portions of each house absorb what seems to us a very large part of the whole, so the public buildings and places of public re¬ sort fill what seems to modern notions a disproportioned space of the whole extent of the city.

With- out books, magazines, and newspapers ; without letters out books, magazines, and newspapers ; without letters to write ; and with a fine climate always attracting them into the open air, there was nothing to call them home but the requisitions of eating and sleeping. One or two facts are expressive upon this point. Pompeii was a city of two miles in circuit, and probably did not contain more than twenty-five thousand inhabitants. The portion which has been thus far excavated does not exceed one-sixth or seventh of the whole extent; yet within that space, have been found an amphitheatre with accommodations for ten thousand persons, and a larger and smaller theatre ; the former prepared for five thousand persons, and the latter for fifteen hun- dred. When we compare these provisions for public amusement in Pompeii with those of a city of similar extent among us, we have a guage by which we may measure the comparative amount of domestic habits and resources in the two cases. In one respect, the comparison between Pompeii and a modern Italian town is favorable to the former. a modern Italian town is favorable to the former.

I need not say that neatness is not a conspicuous virtue among the people who live around Vesuvius at this day, and that the houses of Torre del Greco or Resina would not stand the examination of a board of health, so well as those of Pompeii. The public buildings of Pompeii, consisting of tem¬ ples, basilicas, forums, and theatres, were doubtless imposing in their aspect and of fine architectural forms, but their ruins are somewhat disappointing from the nature of their materials. They were not built of marble or stone, but of brick covered over with stucco. This will do very well in a climate so mild as that of southern Italy ; but nothing is more paltry and shabby than a brick ruin. Vegetation must give it grace and beauty, and there is none here. The visitor is con- ducted to a wide space strewn over with shafts and cap- itals of columns, with fallen pediments, broken walls, yawning chasms half filled with rubbish, and shapeless masses of masonry, and he is told that here, was a basilica and there, a forum and a temple ; but unless his eye be so trained as to see beauty in deformity and symmetry in disorder, he must turn“ away discouraged and disappointed. Under the guidance of our well-mannered Cicerone, we saw the usual points and objects of interest. Among these are, a fine painting of Diana and Acteon the wall of the house of Sallust ; a beautiful altar, of mar- ble, in the temple of Mercury ; a Sphynx, of the same material, in the house of Faunus ; the mosaic labyrinth which gives its name to the house where it was found ;                                  "

By far the finest house within the walls is one which had been discovered and laid bare about four months previous to the date of our visit, called the house of the Suonatrice, from a painting of a female playing on à pipe, at the entrance. This house was deemed of such peculiar interest, that it was under the charge of à special custode, and was only to be seen on payment of an extra fee. It was not of large size, but had evi- of an extra fee. It was not of large size, but had evi- dently been occupied by a person of ample fortune and exquisite taste. The paintings on the walls were nu¬ merous, and in the most perfect preservation. In the rear was a minute garden not more than twenty or thirty feet square, with a fairy fountain the centre; around which were several small statues of children and animals, of white marble, wrought with considera- ble skill. The whole thing had a very curious effect -like the tasteful baby-house of a grown-up child. Every thing in this house was in the most wonderful preservation. The metal pipes which distributed the water, and the cocks by which it was let off, looked perfectly suited for use. Nothing at Pompeii seemed so real as this house, and nowhere else were the em¬ bellishments so numerous and so costly. Pompeii, though a Roman city in its political rela¬ tions, was every where strongly marked with the im¬ press of the Greek mind.

It has been conjectured that Pompeii had an unusually large proportion of men of property, who had been drawn there by the charms of its situation and climate. and that it thus extended a liberal patronage to Greek architects, painters, and sculptors. At any rate, the spirit of Greece still lives and breathes in its ashes. Its temples, as restored by modern architects, are Greek. Its works in marble and bronze claim a place in that cyclus of art of which the metopes of the Parthenon are the highest point of excellence. The pictures that embellish the walls, the unzoned nymphs, the hounding Bacchantes, the grotesque Fauns, the playful arabesques all are informed with the airy and creative spirit of Greek art. The ruins of Pompeii are not merely an open-air museum of curiosities, but they have great value in the illustration they offer to Roman history and Roman litérature. The antiquarian of our times studies the great realm of the past with incomparable advantage, by the help of the torch here lighted. Especially, the knowledge we here gain, directly and indirectly, upon Roman civilization — using that word in its most com¬ prehensive sense — is important both in character and amount. On this point, scholars, naturally enough, are led into exaggeration and overstatements, from taking one or two favorable elements as the standard by which the whole life is judged.

His house had no chimney a rare and costly luxury. His house had no chimney for the escape of smoke. His garden and farming tools were heavy and ill-contrived. His dinners were not graced with the convenience of a fork, and his bed was a heap of garments spread upon the floor. In all that relates to dress and ornament, the same inconsistency is observable. The rings, chains, brace¬ lets, and broaches worn by the ladies and gentlemen of Pompeii were, to say the least, equal to the finest works of modern jewelry ; but in the substantial articles of dress, our superiority is infinite. The substitution of silk, cotton, and linen for wool is an unspeakable advantage in health as well as comfort. Not that these materials were unknown to the Romans, but their use was so rare and exceptional, as hardly to be taken into account.

It was an immense shawl, made of wool of the natural color, imperfectly cleansed from the animal oil, and by no means of the delicate and flexible texture of our fine flannels. Imagine a fine gentleman sweltering under this load of woollen, on a hot day in August, and we shall be dis¬ posed to credit the statement of Pliny, that the bath was sometimes resorted to seven times in one day. The grace and beauty of the female form are also seen in modern times to greater advantage, not only from the improvement in materials, but from the more be¬ the improvement in materials, but from the more be¬ coming and convenient form and fashion of the gar¬ ments worn. “Tunica’ and ’stola’ have a more imposing sound than gown or petticoat; but their loose, flowing and bagging character must have been awk- ward and unsightly — confounding fine with ordinary forms — and in a high wind must have kept their fair wearers in a constant state of alarm. Shoes and stock- ings, too, it will be admitted, are better than sandals, though sculptors say that the use of the former has spoiled the foot. But the superiority of modern times is mostly seen in the greater variety of occupations and resources which they furnish, and especially in the higher char¬ acter of those resources. Man is an animal that can- not long be left in safety without occupation : the growth of his fallow nature is apt to run into weeds. Imagine newspapers and periodical literature struck out of existence, and books and letter-writing confined to a favored few, and can it be doubted that all forms of demoralizing and corrupting amusement would put on a fearfully increased amount of temptation — that on a fearfully increased amount of temptation — that                                  "

What was the state of Pompeii ? There, the wealthy citizen, leaving a house in which Grecian art had surrounded him with an atmosphere of ideal beauty, went to the amphitheatre, where he sat for hours witnessing the most cruel and brutalizing of sports; men hacking each other to pieces, or fighting with wild beasts, till the sand of the arena became soaked with blood. The tasteful amateur of art, when we look upon him from the side of humanity and phi¬ lanthropy, is not much above a New Zealand can- nibal. Nor is this all: The discoveries in Pompeii and Herculaneum present a fearful weight of evidence, in addition to that which literature had previously fur- nished, that among the Romans the vice of cruelty was attended with its twin vice of lust. The foulest epi¬ grams of Martial, the grossest descriptions in Petro- nius and Apuleius, are illustrated to the eye in the remains of these cities, in sculptured and pictorial rep¬ resentations, the very remembrance of which pollutes the imagination. The husband father in Pompeii the imagination. The husband father in Pompeii saw daily, before his own eyes and the eyes of his wife and daughters, subjects delineated which no man should ever look at a second time. Whether we regard such things as cause or effect, they are equally mournful to contemplate. What must have been the tone of con¬ versation and sentiment, and the standard of morals in a community where such atrocities were tolerated, not a community where such atrocities were tolerated, not to say, favored?

The work of excavation at Pompeii goes on slowly, Sir Wm. Gell, in 1835, estimated that about one-eighth only of the area enclosed by the walls and supposed suburbs had been laid bare ; and the labors of the workmen have not proceeded at any greater speed since that time than before. The sheer wall of dark gray gravel which bounds the excavated portion can- not be looked upon without the deepest interest and curiosity; and the imagination busies itself in depicting the wealth which lies hidden in its silent depths. No one can view it without wishing to have his eves touched with that magic ointment of the Arabian tale, which gave the power of seeing all the treasures which are concealed in the bosom of the earth. It is com- mon for travellers to express impatience at the slow rate at which the excavations proceed, and to complain that the government does not employ the utmost avail¬ able amount of force, until the whole city is uncovered; but there is something to be said on the other side. The shroud of earth and ashes preserves what it hides. As soon as a house is exposed to the sun and air. the process of decay begins.

Tempted by the first day of sunshine and blue sky we had recently enjoyed, and by the convenient proximity of a little congress of donkeys, we one day chartered of a little congress of donkeys, we one day chartered two of these quadrupeds and a biped guide for an excur¬ sion to the Camaldoli Convent, on the height above Naples, about five miles distant. The donkey flourishes in great vigor on the soil of Naples; and he is well fitted for excursions in the neighborhood, where there is a good deal of up-hill work to be done, and where every body, who has an eye in his head, is willing to move at a slow pace. Justice has hardly been done to the moral qualities of this respectable quadruped. He is strong, sure-footed, and easy ; and as to his obstinacy, we have never and easy ; and as to his obstinacy, we have never heard but one side of the story. If ever a misanthro¬ pic donkey should publish his autobiography, he may have much to say of the obstinacy of man. The road to the convent was a gradual ascent. A few weeks later, the trees and vines would have been in full leaf, and given it a grace which then it wanted. But it was not too early for flowers, which grew all along the path in the greatest profusion; in some places, spreading a rich carpet which concealed the soil on which they grew.

He had the air of a man whose mind was fading away from want of nutrition, like the light of a candle burnt to its socket. When he learned that we were from America, he asked us for some tobacco, as a remedy for the tooth¬ ache, with which he said he was troubled. For the first time in my life, I regretted my abstinence from the Virginian weed, in all its forms; and felt some- thing like a pang that none of our party had the power of throwing this small pleasure upon his dreary path.

We offered him some money, which he at first refused; but upon our pressing it upon him, he took it and gave it to one of a group of three men who stood near us, and who, as he told us, were out who stood near us, and who, as he told us, were out of employment and had come to the convent to beg.

But life is but another name for development; and to take a youth, with an empty mind, an unfurnished memory, without with an empty mind, an unfurnished memory, without expérience, and without resources, and immerse him in the dreary grave of a monastery, what is it but to give a draught of slow poison to the soul itself ? a draught of slow poison to the soul itself ?

This enterprise is neither difficult nor dangerous ; and may be so managed as not to be very fatiguing. The great laws of political economy regu¬ lating supply and demand are here in full force, Every body wishes to go to the top of Vesuvius, and consequently there are ways and means contrived for getting every body up. As to the best time for making such an excursion, there is a difference of opinion among the learned. The most energetic class of tray¬ ellers — those who are every where disposed to dive the deepest and stay under water the longest — will the deepest and stay under water the longest — will insist upon it that the visitor should leave his comfort¬ able bed at midnight, climb up the mountain by torch¬ light, and see the sun rise from the top. But nature’s voice, through all her works, protests against such rude disruptions of ordinary habits ; and without wishing to speak disrespectfully of sunrises, it may be observed, that those persons who, from unnatural tastes or en- forced circumstances, are in the habit of seeing sun¬ rises, take rather a malicious pleasure in overstating their claims, which a judicial eye easily pronounces to be inferior to those of sunsets.

In this view, it is therefore advisable to leave Naples early in the afternoon, see the sunset from the summit, remain there till after the darkness comes on, and return in the evening; and if the traveller can find and return in the evening; and if the traveller can find a voung moon to light him home, so much the better. This, at any rate, was the plan which, after mature re¬ flection, was adopted by me and the friends who went with me, and we certainly had no reason to regret the choice. We left Naples between twelve and one, and drove to Resina, which we reached in about an hour — the whole distance swarming with population, and present- ing an almost unbroken succession of houses. On arriving at Resina, we found a congregation of horses and guides at hand, waiting to be engaged ; and in a and guides at hand, waiting to be engaged ; and in a few moments the arrangements were made, each of the party and a guide being mounted on horseback.

After leaving the town and gradually dropping our escort, we entered upon a continually ascending path which led us over the remains of old eruptions. But time had so crumbled and decomposed the volcanic products, as to form a loose and friable soil of great fertility. Vines grew thickly and luxuriantly ; trees stood in goodly rows ; and garden vegetables were ex- tensively cultivated. The bean plant, at that time in full blossom, filled the air with its delicate fragrance. The only thing that seemed wanting was grass. There The only thing that seemed wanting was grass. There were no smooth lawns or green pastures, but the sur¬ face of the soil every where was of an uniform iron- gray tint.

In about an hour after leaving Resina, we reached the Hermitage, so called. Here are two buildings one, a sort of osteria, or place of entertainment ; the other, of larger size and more imposing aspect, had the appearance of some kind of public establishment.

Mount Somma, when viewed from a distance, looks like a separate peak, but is really a precipitous escarpment, surrounding for half a circle the true sum¬ mit of Vesuvius. An inverted cup, in half a saucer, will serve as a homely illustration of the relations of the two. This circular ridge of Mount Somma is supposed to be part of the edge or lip of the ancient crater of the mountain, prior to the first recorded eruption, A. D. 79. After leaving the Hermitage, a change came over the character of the tract which the road traversed. Every thing was grim, savage, and forlorn. No form of vege- table life gladdened the eye, and not an insect animated the scene. Nature seemed to have retired from the unequal contest, and given over the whole region to the ster genius of desolation. The landscape was lying dead upon its bier, with ashes strewn upon the corpse. Every thing around bore the impress of ruin, struggle, and conflict. Masses of lava, of various shades of brown and gray according to the dates of their deposit, were piled upon and tumbled over each other, cleft into seams, and twisted into uncouth shapes — the into seams, and twisted into uncouth shapes — the whole scene resembling a field of battle covered with the wrecks and fragments of a deadly fight.

With some experience as a pedestrian, nothing that I had ever known in the way of foot-work bears any comparison to this. It is like such walking as we sometimes dream of, when the feet seem shod with lead or are glued to the ground, and we struggle and strain but never get on.

Besides these, there were several men and boys who seemed to be going up on their own account, some carrying fruit, loaves of bread, and bottles of wine, and some, empty¬ handed, intending to pick up a few grani by lighting sticks at a bed of lava, or putting copper coins into it till they became encrusted. One man carried a heavy basket of oranges and bottles of wine on his head, and yet walked up the hill with hardly a pause, and apparently with little more effort than if he had been on the Toledo at Naples. It was nearly five o’clock when we reached the top of the great cone, and stood face to face with all the terrors and sublimities of Vesuvius. Before us, at a distance of about three hundred yards, was a second and smaller cone of ashes, the vent or funnel through which the fiery contents of the volcano, which for many which the fiery contents of the volcano, which for many days had been in a state of unusual activity, were ejected. At intervals of about a minute, large quanti¬ ties of red-hot stones were thrown into the air, through the opening at the top of the cone, accompanied by a loud the opening at the top of the cone, accompanied by a loud crashing and hissing sound, very like that made by a large wave breaking upon a shingly beach. The cone appeared to be from three to five hundred feet high, yet in many cases so prodigious was the projectile force, that masses of stone of considerable size were thrown to a height equal to that of the cone itself, and the to a height equal to that of the cone itself, and the heavy thump, with which they fell upon its ashy sides, had a sound of death in it.

On every side, the scene was one of the most solemn and awful desolation — the sublime archi¬ tecture of ruin — peaks, dells, and plains of funereal laya — the beds of extinct fire-torrents — the surface every where tossed and broken, as if a stormy sea had been arrested in a moment and turned into a solid mass. It was the most striking embodiment of death brought into immediate contrast with the most intense and fiery life. Between the spot where I stood and the base of the cone there was a constant oozing and flowing forth of streams of lava, the general appearance of which did not quite correspond with the impressions 1 had formed of it. It was a tamer and less formidable thing than 1 had supposed. It did not leap forth from any defined vent or orifice, but seemed to exude from the soil like pitch from a pine. I had imagined that it was like a stream of molten metal running from a furnace, and smiting upon the eye with intolerable splendor. But the surface cools immediately upon exposure to the air, and after gliding a few feet, it looks like a contin¬ uous mass of compact and glowing coals, on the top of which lies a blackened crust of coke and charcoal. Its rate of progress is, or was, as I saw it, very slow. It flowed along a well-defined trench or channel, the edge of which, by daylight, did not differ materially in ap¬ pearance from the cooled surface of the lava, so that                                  "

Sometimes it fell over a sheer descent of a few feet. forming a glowing fire-fall— in imitation of water tumbling over a rocky ledge. The cool surface would be the first to drop off at the edge or angle of the wall. leaving a sheet or line of pure fire. The glowing stream could be approached near enough to thrust a stick into it, though such neighborhood was too uncom- fortable to be borne for a long time. The day of my ascent was the seventeenth of March. and of course the sun set at about six. As the veil of darkness was gradually drawn over the landscape, the impression of the scene grew deeper, and its sublimity more awful and overpowering. The lava, that had a faint and sickly gleam while the sun was upon it, now burned with a fierce, deep red, that was at once beau- tiful and fearful. All around, in spots removed from the flowing mass, ruddy streaks of fire shot up through the crevices of the broken soil. The red-hot stones the crevices of the broken soil. The red-hot stones that were ejected from the cone could be followed in eyery point of their flight, till they rose so high in the darkening air as to present only a quivering point of light to the eye. The smoke and fine ashes also thrown from the cone, passing off in wreaths and curls, were touched with changing colors of red, orange, and yellow. To complete the marvels of this indescribable scène, a young moon was high in the calm, blue heavens above, whose rays dappled the gray waste with lights of silver and shadows of ebony, and blended with the broad red banners of the lava streams and the smoke and upward-shooting stars of the cone,                                   "

Of all the works of God upon which I have ever looked, including Niagara, Mount Blanc, the pass of the Stelvio, and the ocean, by far the most awful and impressive was the cone of Vesuvius as I saw it. Nothing viewed under the ordinary condi- tions of life is any preparation for a volcano in a state of activity. This not the case with other striking phenomena of nature. A hill is suggestive of the highest mountain ; a lake, of the ocean ; and the dash of a mountain-stream over a ledge of rocks, of Niagara. of a mountain-stream over a ledge of rocks, of Niagara.

It is a new revelation of omnipotent power, and of the a new revelation of omnipotent power, and of the weakness of man. Between seven and eight we turned our faces home- wards.

A great city is within an hour’s reach ; and the shadow of Vesuvius hangs over the landscape, keeping the imagination awake by touches of mystery and terror. From Castellamare to Sorrento, a noble road has within a few years past been constructed between the mountains and the sea; which in many places are so close together that the width of the road occupies the whole intervening space.

This was no fanciful apprehension; for not long before, two or three immense masses, each for not long before, two or three immense masses, each as large as a good sized cottage, had fallen from the as large as a good sized cottage, had fallen from the cliff, and were blocking up the road so that it was im¬ possible to get round or over them.

But Virgil’s air-castle includes a Lycoris ; that is, sympa¬ thy, affection, and the heart’s daily food.

The moment the traveller is put ashore, he begins to climb up a sharp ascent. But at Sorrento, on the northern side, this abrupt line of the coast is varied by a plain of some four miles in length and two or three in breadth, thrown up by volcanic agency and filling a rounded gulf or bay left originally by the receding hills. This plain, on every side except towards the sea, is shoul¬ dered by mountains ; so that it lies like a green and motionless lake on the lap of the hills. The coast line is a broken wall of volcanic tufa, varying in height, with projecting buttresses and receding hollows, worn, channelled, and fluted by the action of water, which, below, has scooped out winding galleries and arched caverns. This line of cliffs, seen from below, is of striking beauty. The rock, being of a soft texture, is every where broken, indented, and honey-combed: shrubs and flowers have found procreant niches and give life to the gray walls: winding paths — half paths and half staircases — lead down to the beach, which                                  "

In many places the vol¬ canic soil has split into clefts and openings, running down from the mountains to the sea, which time has enlarged into picturesque glens. A formation like that of the cliff of Sorrento, if stretched along the coast of the cliff of Sorrento, if stretched along the coast of New England, exposed to the action of our high tides and the shocks of our north-easterly storms, would ere this have been worn away, and the superincumbent plain have disappeared; but here, the power of the sea is merely enough to ensure a constant variety of sur- face. At the base of the cliff many cavernous open¬ ings and passages have been scooped out, into which boats can pass. The softer portions of the upper part of the wall are slowly eaten away by time, and masses are occasionally loosened and drop off. The tradition of the place is, that a part of the house in which the of the place is, that a part of the house in which the father of Tasso resided fell into the sea, soon after the poet’s birth; and with it the room in which he first saw the light.

The remainder of the day was passed in ram- bling about the town, along the shore, and climbing to the top of the projecting headland, called the Cape of the top of the projecting headland, called the Cape of Sorrento, which shuts in the plain on the south-west. Wild flowers grew in great profusion all along the shore, among which the color of yellow predominated; as if they had absorbed the golden sunbeams that fertilize the soil. The ridge of the promontory was thickly overgrown with myrtle, and with spiry cones of heath covered with delicate white blossoms like seed pearl. In one place, a fairy waterfall was leaping down the rocks. A few fishing vessels were drawn up along the shore : one bore the appropriate name of Il Nuovo Amore. Groups of women and children gave life to the scene ; some of the former had distaffs in their hands. Blue eyes and brown hair were not uncommon. Beggars, of course, were not wanting, though not in such force as in places nearer Naples. Every point on which the eye fell was a picture : the gray and crumbling cliffs mantling with vegetation, the white, cubical houses, the groups of fishermen and their families on the shore, and the distant mountains all realized a poet’s or a painter’s dreams of a vision¬ ary Italy. In the town itself, whenever the eye could overpeer the churlish wall, it beheld dark green domes of foliage, in which oranges glowed like stars. The vines were not yet in leaf.

The spirit of the scene and the hour fell upon us all, and the only words spoken were occasional exclamations of delight at what was before and around us.

On one side, is a row of tall, shewy houses; on the other, the broad mirror of the bay, from which the light is thrown and multiplied in dazzling gleams.

It is characteristic of the way in which things are done in this part of the world, that there are no sidewalks nor any protection whatever for foot-passengers.

But there is quite enough of interest clinging round it, from the fact that a long line of poets and scholars, beginning with Petrarch and Boccaccio, have visited the spot, more in the spirit of faith than of scepticism. There is nothing at all remarkable in the structure itself, which is of brick, shattered by time and overgrown with myrtle, wild vines, and grass. Laurels should be there, but are not. They have frequently been planted, but the rapacity of visitors has cut them to pieces and brought them to an untimely end.

Continuing our drive to Baiæ we passed by tha Monte Nuovo, which was thrown up by volcanic agency, no more than three hundred years ago, in the space of forty-eight hours, blotting out a large part of the Lucrine lake.

This shore, as every scholar knows, was the focal point of Roman luxury and splendor, glittering with palaces, temples, and villas; so charming from its climate and position, that men who might elsewhere have enclosed square miles for their pleasure-grounds, were here content with an acre. We were taken through the usual curriculum of sight-seeing, but the only thing that made much im¬ pression upon me was the Piscina Mirabile, so called; an underground structure or cistern, about two hundred and twenty feet long and one hundred broad, with a and twenty feet long and one hundred broad, with a vaulted roof, divided into four aisles or compartments, resting upon forty-eight pilasters. If this was, as it is generally admitted, a reservoir for water, for the use of the Roman fleet, it leaves an impression of the extent of the Roman fleet, it leaves an impression of the extent of their marine, hardly warranted by other records, written or monumental. Perhaps here, as in other cases, the Roman taste for architectural splendor led them to go far beyond the demands of mere utility. The day was one of rare beauty, and the rich light that hung upon the islands and the waters of the bay, and the striking features of the coast, notched, scooped, and abraded by the cutting and rending action of fire, pre- sented attractions far more powerful than any work of man’s hands.

I attended one performance at the theatre of San Carlo, a structure of immense size, containing six rows of private boxes, all glittering in blue and gold. The boxes are of large size, quite like small drawing- rooms ; and indeed they are much used by the occu- pants for the reception of their friends. The royal box, blazing in crimson and gold, faces the stage, and is two rows in height; almost large enough to have à vaudeville of its own going on contemporaneously with the performance on the stage. The seats in the pit are the performance on the stage. The seats in the pit are numbered, and the most comfortable 1 have ever seen. The effect of an enclosed space, of such vast extent, is very striking; and such colossal structures present great advantages for all spectacles addressed to the eve ; but for music, vocal music at least, a smaller building is surely better adapted. The opera I saw was Nabuco, by Verdi, a composer whose resonant and superficial strains seemed in unison with the huge vault into which they flowed. There was an ex- cellent orchestra, with a very fair company; and the performer who sustained the principal part was a good actor and a pleasing singer.

NAPLES is a city which most travellers approach with a stock of ready-made impressions, and they look- about to have these impressions confirmed ; and every thing which has that tendency is noted and recorded, while the rest is unheeded and forgotten. Many years ago, there were a considerable number of Lazzaroni so called, in Naples, who had no fixed place of abode; slept in any sheltered spot they could find; were rich if they could call a shirt, a pair of trowsers, and a red cap their own; and when they had earned enough by any chance job to support them through the day, left off work and took to lounging and basking in the sun. The traveller who comes here from the north, when he sees a man in a ragged garb, on a sunny day, he sees a man in a ragged garb, on a sunny day, sleeping under the shelter of a wall, sets it down in his note-book as an unexampled phenomenon, exults in having caught a Lazzarone, and very likely flowers out into a dissertation upon the subject.

The truth is, that the whole race of Lazzaroni, as a class characteristic of and peculiar to Naples, has nearly disappeared. The lapse of time, and the greatly extended net-work of communication between Naples and the rest of Eu- of communication between Naples and the rest of Eu- rope, by means of the increased facilities of travel, have completed a change which began under the trenchant administration of the French, and much obliterated the distinctions once existing between the lower orders in Naples and those in the other large capitals of Europe. In other respects, too, the peculiarities of Naples are growing less and less marked, and those racy traits of life and character which so much impressed the travel- lers of a earlier period, are fast disappearing from observation. Still, there is and ever must be an indi- vidual and strongly-marked expression in the character of Neapolitan life. Much of it is determined by the of Neapolitan life. Much of it is determined by the position of the city upon the earth’s surface. Naples is the fifth in size of the European capitals — London, Paris, Berlin, and St. Petersburg, only, ranking above it;* and Paris, the most southerly of these three, is four hundred miles north of Naples. Naples is a southern city of the first class. The cold is never formidable; and for seven or eight months in -the year it is possi- ble for a healthy man to sleep in the open air without discomfort. This leads to a great deal of open-air life. Many of the trades and occupations, which in * Constantinople, from its peculiar character and position, is not included in this list. is not included in this list.                                 "

Travellers, who have resided in Naples long enough to become ac¬ quainted with its society, say that this same general trait manifests itself also among the more favored classes, in a want of personal delicacy, in careless habits as to dress, and in a style of conversation in which embarrassing topics are discussed with alarming unreserve.

To the swarm of unthinking ephemera that hum and dart in the sunshine, the present is every thing and the past is nothing ; nor indeed is there any thing in the past history of Naples, as compared with its present state, to throw a shadow on the brow of the most sensitive patriot. There is no ghost of departed power and glory to rise up and frown upon the giddy gaiety of a thoughtless race. In Naples, the outward aspect of the earth, sea, and sky, have passed into the spirit of man and kindled it to a genial emulation with nature. The better classes are fond of shewy colors in their dress. Soldiers in gay uniforms take the place of the ecclesiastics in Rome. That taste for rich and gorgeous splendor which we notice as characteristic of the African race, sheds its influence over the city upon the African race, sheds its influence over the city upon which the wind from Africa so often blows.

Naples and its neighborhood are so lovely that there is no room for the ideal. There is so much to be enjoyed that there is no time for study. It is a curious fact, that Naples has produced but one great landscape¬ painter, Salvator Rosa, and that his inspiration was drawn, not from the characteristic scenery of Naples, but from the wooded mountains of La Cava and No¬ cera. No Neapolitan painter has ever warmed his canvas with the pearly lights of Cuyp, or spread over it the aerial gold of Claude Lorraine. In this, as in so many other things, successful work is the result of a due proportion between the task and the instrument. Southey, whose literary industry was so remarkable within the range of his own library, said, that he should never have accomplished any thing, if his energies had been buried under the vast stores of the British Museum. The Dutch painter, who, when he looked out of the window, saw a meadow, a windmill, a willow-tree hanging over a brook, or a rainy sunset behind a row of trees, felt himself competent to grapple with such themes, and set himself to work accordingly ; but what artist would not fold his hands in despair before the glories of a sunset in the bay of Naples? In personal appearance, so far as my own observa¬ tion went, the advantage is decidedly with the Romans. There are more fine faces in the latter city, and gen¬ erally a higher expression and loftier carriage.

The virtues of the lower orders of the Neapolitans are said to be good-humor and temperance, and under certain qualifications, honesty. That is to say, a Neapolitan lazzarone will scrupulously account for the money which is entrusted to him, from a sense of honor, but will not hesitate to pick a pocket when under no such restraint. Pocket-picking is a very common accomplishment here, and handkerchiefs, especially, are apt to take to themselves wings and fly away.

It is the misfortune of Naples, that while the upper classes are corrupted with the worst vices of civiliza¬ tion, and the lower orders lead a life of somewhat savage unrestraint and lawless abandonment to their instincts, the middle and industrious class — which generally acts as a moral check and counterpoise to the two extremes — is here smaller and less influential than in the other cities of the first class in Europe. Of course, I have no personal knowledge of the upper classes in Neapolitan society, but that they are, with many marked exceptions, worthless and corrupt, is the general verdict passed upon them by competent ob¬ servers. The soft climate of Naples has melted away the two great guardian virtues, in which the security for the two great guardian virtues, in which the security for all the others resides ; valor in man, and chastity in woman.

The burden of cold, which is so great an element of wretchedness in northern capitals, is there hardly felt at all ; but many lives are unquestionably shortened by hunger in a land that so teems with plenty. The childlike unconcern for the future, of which I have before spoken, lies at the bot- tom of this. Marriages are contracted most heedlessly and improvidently, with no provision for a rainy day, and the poor children that are thus called into being, are born to a life of wretchedness and poverty ; from which, however, they draw no warnings of experience, but they, in their turn, having scrambled along to ma¬ turity, through rags and hunger, repeat the heedless folly of their parents, and thus transmit the inheritance of misery.* The Neapolitans are said to be an indolent race, but here, as in many other places, it is difficult to say how much of this indolence is to be ascribed to a distaste for labor, and how much to want of motive and oppor- tunity. We are apt to make rash judgments on this point. The Irish, for instance, are often accused of indolence in their own country ; but we know that with us they are a hard-working race. The reason is that a new set of impulses is waked to life upon our soil, and that the natural instincts of accumulation and progress become propelling powers.

Naples suffers their misfortune as well as their fault. Naples suffers from over-population, and there is neither employment nor food for all who seek them.

Our spring is a piece of mosaic, with here a bit of winter, and there a bit of summer. In our météreo¬ logical alphabet, B. does not follow A. A soft vernal day is succeeded by piercing winds, and open windows and fires alternate capriciously.

But in Rome the spring is a well-defined period which divides winter from summer, has a character of its own, and is not à com¬ posite season made up by contributions from the other two. The year puts off the garments of winter and puts on the robes of spring, with deliberate change. With each day there comes a livelier green and a deeper blue, and with gentle, imperceptible gradations, the hours glide on to the full maturity of summer. Rome shews to particular advantage at this season, because there are so many gardens, villas, and patches of cul¬ tivated ground within the circuit of the walls, and a few moment’s walk will, from any point, enable à visitor to surround himself with all the fine influences of nature.

Besides the horror which so sacrilegious an act awakened in every good Catholic, the theft involved à considerable pecuniary loss, for the head was en- closed in a silver case, set with jewels, valued at about twenty thousand dollars.

The length of the procession, the superb costumes defying the most piercing power of daylight, the grand dimensions of the piazza itself, the noble architectural forms on either side, and the animation and interest which glowed in every counte- nance, covered and concealed the theatrical element, and left only a stately symbol, in which the grateful sense of a religious community put on an outward form, such as suited their susceptible temperament and their ever-hungry senses. It is only on occasions like these that we see and feel the whole power of the Romish Church, which, on ordinary ceremonials, seems to hold back and keep in reserve one half its resources. The most conscientious Protestant, unless he were as hard and as cold as the stones on which he stood, could not help ceasing to protest, for the moment at least ; nor could he fail to feel upon his heart the benediction of waters, drawn from the common stream of faith and emotion before it had reached the dividing rock. In the evening, a finer and fuller illumination of St. Peter’s took place than on the previous week. This one of those sights of which the reality surpasses all previous imagination. An illumination is always beau¬ tiful, but the enormous size of St. Peter’s makes it sub- lime. The defects of the building are lost, and only its majestic outlines are traced in horizontal and per¬ pendicular lines of fire.

The tremulous movement given to the flames of the lamps by the wind, adds greatly to the effect. It seems as if a shower of stars had fallen upon the building, and were vet quivering and trembling with the shock.

Upon the highest peak of the range was the temple of Jupiter Latiaris, where all the tribes of Latin blood, the Romans included, met every year to worship; and where the victorious generals of the republic repaired to offer praises and acknowledgments. In these moun- tain glens, undoubtedly, most of that ballad literature of Rome, the loss of which Macaulay so eloquently of Rome, the loss of which Macaulay so eloquently laments, and so successfully restores, had its origin. Nor need the scholar be reminded that this the scene of the most original and vigorous portions of the AEneid of the most original and vigorous portions of the AEneid of Virgil; nor how the genius of the poet, which rather of Virgil; nor how the genius of the poet, which rather languidly recounts the traditions borrowed from Greece, wakes to new life, when he feels his feet upon his own soil, and deals with Latin names and Latin legends. To this Alban Mount, in exploring which many weeks might be profitably and agreeably spent, I could only give two days.

Among them the arts of sculpture, painting, poetry, and music were worthily represented, and there was a common fund of frankness, good-humor, animal spirits, and love of nature, from which all drew in fair proportions.

The road led through woodlands and pastures, not unlike some portions of New England, and opened widening pros¬ pects as we ascended. Here are many interesting ruins, especially the remains of a theatre, most of the seats of which were hewn from the living rock, as was often the case with such structures among the ancients. It is difficult, however, for any one to waste a look upon a dead ruin upon a spot from which so living and upon a dead ruin upon a spot from which so living and glorious a landscape may be seen. On one side are Rome, crowned with the dome of St. Peter’s, and the Campagna, a motionless sea of green, which imper¬ ceptibly flows into the living blue of the Mediterranean. On the opposite side are the Alban Valley, traversed by the Via Latina, the wooded crest of Monte Pila, the Camp of Hannibal, the convent on Monte Cavi, and the ridge of Alba Longa — a landscape as exhilarating from its variety and picturesque contrasts as that to¬ wards Rome is impressive from its vastness and mo¬ notony. On our way back we paid a visit to the Villa Rufinella, which is splendidly situated on the summit of a hill, and commanding a prospect hardly inferior to that and commanding a prospect hardly inferior to that from the site of Tusculum.

This villa was unoccupied except by a steward or bailiff, who looked after the grounds and received the visitors. On our return to Frascati we visited the most cele¬ brated of its villas, the Villa Aldobrandini. Erected during the latter part of the sixteenth century, by Car¬ dinal Pietro Aldobrandini, nephew of Pope Clement VIII., under the superintendence of Giacomo della Porta, it stands as a most striking memorial of the great resources held by the ecclesiastical nobility of that age, and the magnificent style in which they were used. It is situated on the sloping side of a hill, and the architect has been happy in the adaptation of his the architect has been happy in the adaptation of his structure to the character of its site, but the building itself has little beauty of outline or proportion.

The next morning, after an early breakfast, we sum- moned once more our faithful friends, the donkeys, and took up our line of march for Albano. It was a bright, sparkling, spring morning, and the early dew yet hung upon the gråss, and thin straggling vapors crept over the plain of the Campagna.

There is nothing very re¬ markable in the architecture or embellishments of this villa, but its situation is fine and the grounds are prettily laid out, though over the whole there hangs an air of neglect; that careless and slipshod look which tells that the master’s eye is withdrawn. As one of our party was in treaty for a suite of rooms in this villa, we went over the interior and examined it with a tenant's dis¬ paraging eye. What we saw is very easily described — a large number of immense rooms, generally open¬ ing into each other, with little or no furniture, and no great promise of that indefinable blessing comfort. Many of the floors were paved with tiles or brick, like the hearth of a country farm-house ; and some of them the hearth of a country farm-house ; and some of them with a diversity of surface like a rolling prairie on a small scale.

After leaving this villa, we entered upon a beautiful sylvan region overshadowed with fine oaks and chest- nuts, and brightened with a luxuriant growth of flowers and flowering shrubs. I was struck, as I had been on the previous day, with the resemblance which the scenery bore to some of the woodland tracts of our own country. There was the same light and airy out- line to the branches, the same delicate tinge of yellow in the green of the foliage, the same tangled variety of growth, and the same look of unpruned and unchecked development. It was a tract of honest wildwood, and not a park run to seed ; and Romulus and Remus could not have picked flowers, or gathered nuts, upon the lap of a more genuine nature. And yet, I trust it will not be deemed unpatriotic to say that no forest that waves over the Mississippi could have the charm that hallowed these venerable woods. The centuries of history and tradition that have passed over these green patriarchs have carved memorials upon their trunks and mingled airy voices with the rustlings of the breeze.

Bristling with towers and surrounded with a ditch, it has more the air of a fortress than of a monastery ; but its style of architecture is well suited to its situation ; its style of architecture is well suited to its situation ; for its frowning aspect is the more impressive from its contrast with the sylvan region, thickly wooded with elms and planes, above which it rises. The great at¬ traction of this monastery consists in a series of seven frescoes by Domenichino, in the chapel ; the subjects of which are taken from the legendary life of St. Nilus, of which are taken from the legendary life of St. Nilus, its founder. So far as a hurried examination of these works enabled me to judge, they seemed of great merit, and not a jot below their high reputation. They do not beat down the mind with superhuman power, like the frescoes of Michael Angelo ; nor fill it with visions of celestial beauty, like those of Raphael. Domenichino was neither a giant nor a seraph. But these works at once delight the taste and satisfy the critical judgment. Their conspicuous excellence consists in their loyalty to truth. There is nothing in them that is false, ex travagant, or affected ; nothing theatrical, distorted, or violent. The expressions and attitudes are such as the subject demands. There is no crowding, hurrying, or jostling in the groups, but every figure has room enough, and moves and breathes freely. Charles Lamb said of and moves and breathes freely.

After leaving Grotta Ferrata, we came in a few mo- ments to Marino, a town finely situated on a hill, and looking very inviting as a place of summer retreat, Hence we passed into a deep glen, beautifully wooded with noble trees — memorable as the place of meet- ing of the Latin tribes, where the brave and rash Turnus Herdonius came to his death by the arts of Tarquin the Proud.

The Pope’s villa at Castel Gandolfo is a comparatively modest mansion, as if the architect had been thinking more of the apostolic, than of the princely character of the tenant, and erected a house for the priest and not à the tenant, and erected a house for the priest and not à palace for the sovereign. Not far from it is a villa belonging to a member of the Torlonia family, more to be coveted than any of the splendid structures at Fras¬ cati ; for its situation is beautiful and commanding, looking down upon the lake and lying open to all the mountain winds ; and it had, besides, an inviting aspect of comfort and habitableness.

It is a cup¬ shaped hollow, and its steep and high banks are coy- éred with a noble growth of stately trees, that would give dignity to the flat sides of a muddy canal.

Beauty so solemn, loneliness so profound, the power stamped upon the grand, old hills, and the gentleness and peace breathed over the unruffled lake, made up a scene which could only be described by the hackneyed epithet of unearthly.

By this process, its circumference, formerly a mile in extent, is now only about fourteen hundred feet.

Besides the impe- rial palace, there were a library, an academy, a lyceum, numerous temples, one or more theatres, a covered walk or portico, and spacious barracks for the accommodation of the Prætorian guards. Besides these, a glen through which a stream flowed was made into a miniature likeness of the vale of Tempe ; a flowery plain was called by the name of the Elysian Fields, and an immense cavern, filled with sunless waters, recalled the gloom of Tartarus. A general plan, embracing such numerous details and executed with such hot haste, could not have been entirely successful unless under the control of the most unerring taste, and it may well be doubted whether the villa of Hadrian, when completed, did not present more points for wonder than admiration.

In its haste to overleap the steeply inclined plane which lies between its upper bed and the calm sea of verdure below, it breaks into a variety of smaller streams which plunge and hurry over the rocky bar- riers, like a company of soldiers who, in the confusion of a retreat, abandon their orderly arrangement and continuous movement; each individual making his es¬ cape, as best he may.

Of these, the finest in picturesque effect are those which flow from the broken arches of an immense ruin called the villa of Mœcenas, which, if that were its true designation, must have been large enough in its perfect state to have accommodated a hundred irritable poets and kept them far enough apart to prevent the possibility of a quarrel.

These streams must be fringed with trees and shrubs compressed between walls of black and dripping rock carved and worn into innumerable fastastic shapes and distributed all along the slopes of a rounded and semicircular hill; with such careful attention to details as if nature had for once relaxed her stern and homely mood, and set herself to work to compose a perfect picture.

There are no manufacturing es¬ tablishments at all, and very little of handicraft occupa¬ tion of any kind. The few articles of foreign growth which the simple wants of the inhabitants require are mostly supplied from Rome; so that there are very few shopkeepers, and those few of a humble class. As no new houses have been built within the memory of man, there is but a limited demand for mechanics. There are priests and physicans; but of the legal profession, at least in its higher departments, probably none.

These, however, form the exception and not the rule, for the greater part of the population are mere day laborers, whose families are crowded into the narrow streets of the towns, and are themselves employed by the great proprietors, especially the mercanti of the Campagna, in labors of cultivation.

But in the neighborhood of Rome, as in Italy generally, the female part of the pop¬ ulation share to a considerable extent in field labors, especially at the times of harvest and vintage ; and in winter they ply the distaff and spindle and manufacture the coarse clothing, both woollen and linen, worn by their families.

The grave and earnest character of our rural population forbids their taking pleasure in many forms of entertainment which excite and gratify the prolonged intellectual childhood of the peasantry of Europe. The amusements of the people of the Alban Mount are generally unintellectual in their character, and ad- dress themselves to the senses. Such entertainments as lectures, discourses, and speeches are wholly un¬ known. Sermons and religious exhortations are mostly confined to the season of Lent. A considerable part of their stock of amusement comes from a source which seems odd enough to a New England man, and that is the church. The Romish church, which providently employs all possible means for holding and retaining influence over the popular mind, takes care to gratify the national taste for brilliant spectacles. Every town and village has one or more saint’s days, which are celebrated every year, and attended by the whole pop¬ ulation of the neighboring country.

Two stout posts, about nine feet high, wound round with leaves, are set up in the middle of the street about three feet apart. Upon these there rests a round transverse stick, passing through the two handles of a bucket or tub, which swings freely below. A peasant by the aid of a ladder fills the bucket with water, and dipping a piece of white paper with a black line upon it into the water, he sticks it on the side of the bucket. it into the water, he sticks it on the side of the bucket. The persons who take part in the sport are mounted upon donkeys, and armed with stout staves pointed at the end with iron. The object of the game is to urge the end with iron. The object of the game is to urge their beasts between the posts, and to hit the paper with the point of their staves — continuing their course so the point of their staves — continuing their course so that the contents of the overturned bucket shall fall upon the ground behind them, or at least upon the haunches of the donkey. But to do all this requires skill and luck, and is rarely achieved. The rider must not only aim right, but at the same time manage his not very docile steed in such a way as to second his purpose. In general, they contrive to hit the mark, but are not quick enough to escape the water.

It is a coarse kind of blindman’s-buff, except that the players strive to catch a pig and not one another. A number of persons are wholly enveloped in sacks of thick linen cloth, which are gathered over the head and tied in such a way as to form a sort of pad or cushion. These prevent the wearers not only from seeing but from running, and they are obliged to make progress by uncouth leaps. Holes are left for the arms to pass through, and each person holds a stick or club in his hand. When ready, these prisoners in sacks are ar- ranged in a circle, and a pig, with a bell round his neck, is put into the centre. At this signal, every man darts forward and moves in the direction of the bell; but at the first impulse, half of them fall down. They tumble over each other, and in the confusion give and receive heavy blows. The pig is the prize of the per¬ son who first holds him in a firm grasp, or knocks him down with a stick. The poor animal, frantic with ter- ror, rushes about among the sacks, and easily throws down the wearers by an unexpected shock ; but his efforts to escape are frustrated by the outer circle of spectators, who drive him back, until the sport is closed by a lucky grasp or blow. The laughable effects and combinations of such a scene may easily be conceived. It is usual for the successful player to invite his com¬ petitors to an entertainment, at which the pig appears as the principal dish. Neither of these sports is cruel or degrading, but they shew a very unripe and boyish taste.

It would surely be better for our people to have no taste at all for amusements, than to find satisfaction in such at all for amusements, than to find satisfaction in such rough horse-play. The industrious habits of the people of New England make the hours of daylight too valuable to be spent in frolic, except on rare occasions. Thus our amuse- ments are, as a general rule, thrown into the evening. But just the reverse is the case upon the Alban Mount. Dancing, for instance, in some form or other, is a gen- eral pastime of the whole human family. We select, for that object, a winter evening and a well-lighted apartment, and add the accessaries of an entertainment and the best music that can be had. But there the young men and women go out on a summer afternoon, and dance hour after hour under a tree — usually not more than one or two couples at a time — and to no other music than the sound of a tamborine. We value dancing not so much for itself as for the exhilarating glow which it diffuses, and the gayer tone of conversa- tion to which it leads ; but the Roman peasantry enjoy it for its own sake. They find pleasure in its mere it for its own sake. They find pleasure in its mere movement, as children do in running about and playing. Here it may be remarked, that our fashion of allowing young persons of different sexes to form parties together for amusement, without the parents, is not at all sanc tioned by the customs of Italy, or indeed of Europe generally. Of intellectual life, as we understand the word, there is not much among the inhabitants of the Alban Mount.

How the ecclesiastics who published, and those who taught this edition of the commandments, could recon¬ cile such a form of untruth to their consciences, may be left to some skilful casuist to settle. An Italian peasant might well be puzzled with the injunction against image worship contained in the second commandment, when compared with the practice of the church. The rural population of the Papal states are by no means without a taste for reading, but the direc¬ tion in which that taste moves marks a difference be¬ tween them and the people of New England. Here we have no such thing as a popular literature, address¬ ing itself to a certain class exclusively, and found only among them. In our country towns, the clergyman and his parishioners, the doctor and his patients, the and his parishioners, the doctor and his patients, the lawyer and his clients, all read the same books, and draw from them common topics of interest and discus¬ sion.

But in Italy, and indeed in many other parts of Europe, we find a popular literature so called — a class of books circulating among the rural population and the lower orders of the towns, cheaply printed on coarse paper, and generally written in some local dialect.

The whole peninsula is very rich in works of this class, and a man of taste and industry in works of this class, and a man of taste and industry might, with no great pains, collect materials for an in¬ teresting book about them.

Ancient mythology and history furnish the materials for another division, with which the legends of saints are sometimes strangely intermingled ; and moral and religious subjects, and the adventures and miracles of holy men, are also a fruitful source of pop¬ ular reading. No books are more eagerly devoured by the people of Rome and its neighborhood than stories of bandits, of Rome and its neighborhood than stories of bandits, outlaws, and robbers. Indeed, the general heart of mankind seems to keep a corner of sympathy for offenders of this class; partly from admiration of their courage, and partly because they are supposed to spare the poor and strip the rich. These books, in general, have little of invention or literary merit of any kind ; nor are they relieved by that vein of hu- mor which runs through the exploits of the English Robin Hood. They are, for the most part, made up of horrors and atrocities : teaching by inference the mischievous doctrine, that a life of crime and vio¬ lence may be expiated by certain formal acts of devotion — especially if crowned by a death-bed re¬ pentance.

Thus, the people of Frascati and Albano stand higher on the scale of good morals and good manners than those of Tivoli and Marino. Almost every town and village has its own character and reputation, which are matters of common notoriety in the neighborhood. The limitation of these local traits is explained by the fact, that the rural population of Italy is for the most part stationary, and that men usually end their days on the spot where they were born, and thus the habits the spot where they were born, and thus the habits and tastes of one generation are transmitted to that which comes after it, without any foreign infusion.

Wine relieves this sense of flatness and inert- ness by the momentary glow and fillip it gives to the languid blood; but the relief thus derived is like the heat of a fire of thorns, and there is thus constant inducement to repeat and increase the remedy.

The Papal government, it is fair to state, was the last to establish a lottery of its own, and devotes a part of the income derived from it to charita¬ ble purposes. The sweeping charge of dissoluteness, so often brought by travellers against the whole people of Italy, is certainly not just when applied to the greater part of its rural population. Indeed, on this point, the observa¬ tions of travellers are made upon a small class of idle men and women, living in large towns, who are doomed men and women, living in large towns, who are doomed either to selfish and heartless celibacy or to marriages of convenience. Where there is want of occupation of convenience. Where there is want of occupation and want of interest, one great safeguard against tempta- tion is removed, and intrigue and gallantry are resorted to by way of pastime, and to give flavor to the insipid to by way of pastime, and to give flavor to the insipid dish of life.

Though the higher classes are profli¬ gate from a want of any elevating object in life and from a corrupt system of marriages, and though the women of the lower orders are often led into evil courses through the pressure of poverty, the middle ranks lead at least decent and reputable lives. But the rural population of the Papal states may indeed in this respect be called a virtuous people. The practice of auricular confession, often abused and always sus¬ of auricular confession, often abused and always sus¬ ceptible of abuse, herein works favorably ; as we also see its good influence in the superior chastity of the Irish peasantry as compared with the English. The conduct of young persons before marriage is regulated by a very rigid law of decorum; and after marriage, besides the restraints of religion and public opinion, the jealous and vindictive temper of the people checks the approach of temptation. An injured husband takes the law into his own hands, and avenges the wrong done to his honor by a stab with a knife ; and éven mere im¬ prudence and levity of conduct is often thus cruelly punished. Nor does the tone of public feeling severely reprobate this wild justice, and bad as it is, it has the reprobate this  wild justice, and bad as it is, it has the effect to prevent the wrong which it so sternly rights. But the rural population of the Roman States cannot be excepted from another charge brought against the Italian people in general, and to which most of them are unhappily obnoxious — that of want of principle and self-respect in all money transactions.

The women did not seem to me so handsome as the men, though among them there are often fine heads and striking countenances. From their habit of carrying burdens upon the head, they are very erect, and their gait and movement are full of emphasis and expression. In young men and women both, there is a great deal of a kind of beauty to which our northern eyes are not a kind of beauty to which our northern eyes are not much accustomed — that derived from color alone. With them the tone of coloring is Venetian ; with us, Umbrian. The complexion is of a rich healthy yellow, with a burnish and glow upon it like that of a ripe nec- tarine; the eyes are of sparkling brown or black ; the teeth, white and regular; and the massive raven hair shines with a sort of metallic light, like a bit of freshly- broken anthracite coal.

The general artist type is more easily re¬ cognized than the particular nationality. The outward appearance of the whole class expresses a pursuit of the picturesque under difficulties. The hair and beard are taught to curl and wave in such a manner as to give, if possible, a romantic and ideal character to commonplace features.

The Germans have, in this art, fairly earned the rank and consideration which they enjoy. Their style of painting is often unfairly judged, because judged by its defects — its stiff outlines, its elaborate precision of de¬ sign, and its watery tone of color. But to do justice to the German school of painting as it now is, we must go back to what it was thirty or forty years ago, when Cornelius, Overbeck, Schadow, and Veit, then residing in Rome, began to breathe into art the breath of spirit- in Rome, began to breathe into art the breath of spirit- ual life, and to grasp the pencil once more with hands as pure as those of Fra Angelico. Before this period, as pure as those of Fra Angelico. Before this period, frivolous or profligate lives expressed themselves in un¬ meaning or sensual forms, and painting aspired to be no more than a kind of luxury addressed to the eye. Cornelius and his friends recognized a higher aim in art, and felt that no amount of technical skill could atone for the want of that vital inspiration which flows from earnestness of purpose, purity of sentiment, and depth of feeling. It was their faith that the artist himself must be a man of pure life and religious spirit, before art could become an instrument of moral and spiritual growth. With these views and in this mood, they dedicated themselves to their work and steadily persevered in their purpose, unmoved by the opposition of the few or the indifference of the many ; until, like of the few or the indifference of the many ; until, like Wordsworth, a kindred spirit in a sister art, they had formed the taste by which they were to be judged. The debt of gratitude which is due to these Luthers and Melancthons in art should be freely paid, and even                                  "

He is a very devout Catholic, and leads a life of almost monastic seclusion. I visited his studio — which is open to the public once a week — and had at the same time the satisfaction of seeing him. He is tall and thin person, subdued in manner, and with a countenance in person, subdued in manner, and with a countenance expressive of benevolence and self-renunciation. His appearance was a combination of the gentleman, the artist, and the monk. The works of his studio were exclusively charcoal drawings of sacred subjects, chiefly taken from the life of the Saviour. They were all char- acterized by depth and purity of sentiment, but in their execution 1 was a little disappointed. They seemed to be drawn with a hesitating hand, as if the mind of the artist had been oppressed with the grandeur of his theme. There was also a want of ideal beauty in the faces, which were cast in a broad Teutonic mould. There was something strongly subjective in their ex- pression, which shewed that they were the productions of a man who lived in seclusion, and reproduced the images of his own mind without replenishing his fancy by observation. The most pleasing of his works was a drawing illustrating the parable of the wise and foolish a drawing illustrating the parable of the wise and foolish virgins. In this, the architecture and accessaries were rather Gothic and mediæval than oriental, and there was a want of grace and ideality in the forms and faces of the principal figures ; but there was great purity of design and truth of sentiment, combined with the most conscientious accuracy of drawing.

Overbeck, from his age, his European reputation, and the high merit of his works, may be said to stand at the head of the artists in Rome; though, from the ascetic seclusion of his habits, he exerts but little per¬ sonal influence upon his professional brethren. No one, however, either in painting or sculpture, has suc- ceeded to the throne left vacant by the illustrious Thor¬ walsden. He was one of those men of northern birth, like Winkelman and Zoega, who find in the scenery, the climate, and the life of Italy, the home of their the climate, and the life of Italy, the home of their hearts ; and become really exiles in the land of their birth. Some critics affect to discover the Scandinavian in his works, and this may be true in his female forms; in his works, and this may be true in his female forms; and it is perhaps also true that in the reactionary state of feeling against Canova and his school, the merits of Thorwalsden may be ranked too high. But it must be admitted that nothing since the brightest days of Grecian sculpture is better than his best works; his statues of Jason and of Mercury, his bas-reliefs of Day and Night, and parts of the Triumph of Alexan- der. He combines more than any other modern sculp- tor, Michael Angelo not excepted, the power of re¬ producing the calm beauty of Grecian art, and the power of expressing in marble the sentiments and affections of the soul. No artist except Raphael ever reigned more supremely over the two realms of form and spirit. He is at once the most classic and the and spirit. He is at once the most classic and the most Christian of sculptors. He is equally at home in these lovely forms of classic mythology which mean                                  "

Thorwalsden was happy in his temperament and disposition as in his genius. He was not goaded by those fervid and impetuous passions which have made the lives of so many artists as turbid and restless as the course of a mountain torrent. His youth was not stormy and his age was not torpid : he had nothing to subdue and nothing to repent. Neither envy nor malice nor hatred ruffled the fountains in which he saw the face of beauty. He waited patiently for fame and wealth ; and when they came, he was not elated by them. No one was inclined to question his title to honors which were so gently worn. Genial, sympa- thetic, retiring in his habits but not ascetic, he never lost his interest in life, nor ceased to follow the fleeting steps of ideal beauty. His simple tastes enabled him to indulge largely in the luxury of giving. He was a generous and discriminating patron of art, and had collected around him a most interesting gallery of the works of living painters, the greater part of which were specially ordered by him. To young sculptors he gave what was better than money — advice, en¬ couragement, and instruction — never seasoned with harshness or arrogance, but always as gently conveyed as gratefully received. Among the artists resident in Rome at the time of my visit were many distinguished men, especially among the sculptors.

Every young artist dreams of Rome as the spot where all his visions may be realized ; and it would indeed seem that there, in a greater degree than any where else, were gathered those influences which ex- pand the blossoms, and ripen the fruit of genius. Nothing can be more delicious than the first experi¬ ences of a dreamy and imaginative young man who comes from a busy and prosaic city, to pursue the study of art in Rome. He finds himself transported into a new world where every thing is touched with finer lights and softer shadows.

Besides, that the accu¬ mulation of so many works of the highest merit, both in sculpture and painting, may act upon many natures in sculpture and painting, may act upon many natures rather as a narcotic than a stimulus, the presence of so much that bewitches the eye has a tendency to draw the attention outward to external objects ; to give to the thoughts a wandering and volatile character, and fill the mind with a flutter of restless images, that never can become fixed. Excellence in art is to be attained by active effort and not by passive impres¬ sions; by the manly overcoming of difficulties; by patient struggle against adverse circumstances; by the thrifty use of moderate opportunities. The great art¬ ists were not rocked and dandled into eminence, but they attained to it by that course of labor and disci¬ pline which no man need go to Rome or Paris or London to enter upon.

To visit the studios of young artists is one of the ap¬ proved methods of disposing of an idle forenoon in Rome, and I sometimes fell in with the general custom. But such expeditions usually threw a shadow upon my spirits, because they left upon my mind a prevailing impression of mediocrity ; sometimes united with mod¬ esty, with industry, with good taste, with just views, but still, mediocrity. But the world does not want medi¬ ocrity in those fine arts which respond to an ultimate instinct, and are not means towards a further end. Of what value is a tolerable picture, a respectable poem, a statue that is not bad ? This is, indeed, in conform¬ a statue that is not bad ? This is, indeed, in conform¬ ity with the ster mood of Nature, which moves by inexorable and unsentimental laws, and is prodigal of promise but sparing in mature results. But it is none the less saddening to be forced to feel that of so many that are called, so few are chosen ; of the hopeful and exulting crowds that start in the race, how many drop on the way, and how few reach the goal ! As I have passed groups and clusters of young artists in Rome, 1 have often thought of an expression which broke from Abernethy, when he came into his lecture-room one morning and saw it thronged with medical students, God help you ! where are you all to find bread? More than once have 1 visited a studio in which one moment’s glance was enough to furnish all the elements by which to calculate the occupant’s horoscope.

The young artist had mistaken sensibility for genius, and dreams for creations. He was destined to join that sad caravan of mediocrity, who wander without making progress ; to become one of those forlorn shadows that are neither good nor bad, whom success never stays to greet, but looks at and passes by on the other side. It is true, that such a lot is not always productive of is true, that such a lot is not always productive of unhappiness, and that moderate powers are often com¬ bined with either a cheerfulness of temperament which makes sunshine for itself, or with an invincible self- esteem which refuses to admit what it cannot but see : so that, on the whole, life is comfortable enough. But all the pursuits of an artist, the hopes on which he feeds, the dreams which visit him, and the daily food of his mind, tend to develope that sensitiveness which, while it enhances the glow of triumph, sharpens also the sting of failure. In common life, it is a misfortune to have more ambition than power; in art, to have more of the vision than the faculty. Unhappy is the life of that artist who will not recognize the inexorable fact of his own mediocrity ; who nurses the delusion that his want of success comes from the obstruction of adverse circumstances, and not from essential defects ; who is ever wooing the beauty which he never can win. His life is, indeed, doubly unhappy ; for his rebellious spirit will check the growth of his powers, and his work will be darkened by the shadows of his discontent. In the fine arts, comparisons are inevitable : there are ranks, degrees, and gradations of excellence.

It is difficult to hit upon the proper shade of language in which to speak of the works or the genius of a valued personal friend. We shrink from excessive praise, as unworthy of the affection which we feel; and in avoiding that, we may fall into a tone of cold¬ ness and restraint, unworthy of the object of that affection. The range of sculpture is not so wide as that of painting; and sculptors differ less among themselves than painters. No two sculptors can stand at points so remote from each other as Rubens and Cornelius, for instance ; both great painters. The distance between one sculptor and another is measured upon the same scale, and the distinction is more that of degree merely, than in painting. To produce the highest excellence in sculpture, the mind and the hand must act together. in sculpture, the mind and the hand must act together. There must be ideal beauty, truth of sentiment, depth of feeling; and there must be also mechanical skill. These two elements — the intellectual and the manual rarely meet.

In mere execution, Bernini’s Sta. Theresa is a more clever work than Maderno’s Sta. Cecilia; but its sentiment is vile, and no man of relig¬ ious feeling, or even moral thoughtfulness, would wish to look upon it a second time. Hence, in works of sculpture we recognize a dis- tinction founded upon the preponderance of the mind or the hand. Crawford belongs to that class of sculp- or the hand. Crawford belongs to that class of sculp- tors whom — for want of a better term — we may call intellectual. In creative power and poetical feeling, I should place him at the head of all his professional brethren in Rome. He is an original thinker in his art: possessing that quality of invention, without which judgment is cold and taste is feeble. He feels and comprehends the antique, but is not imprisoned within its range. We may apply to him what was so happily said of Cowley, that he wears the garb but not the clothes of the ancients. He is capable, alike, of ex¬ pressing modern ideas in marble, and of reproducing the fine forms of Grecian art. Let it not be inferred from what I have said, that Crawford is at all deficient in mechanical skill. No one is capable of giving a more minute and careful finish to his works, if he will; but it is true that he does not always do himself justice in this respect. He has something of the impatience of genius : before an image of beauty has been turned to form, another takes pos- session of his mind; and the new impulse will not per¬                                  "

The reception in Boston of his statue of Orpheus, in 1841, was a marked era in his life : the merits of this fine work introduced him to a larger circle of admirers than he had before possessed, but it did not surprise those who had previously known him. His nature is concentrated and reserved ; his sympa¬ thies deep and strong, but not lightly stirred. Loved and valued by those who know him, his manner, in general, does not commend his fine genius and sub¬ stantial worth to those who see him but casually.

Like all men who, during the forming period of life, have lived much alone, and pursued a greät object with intense self-devotion, his spirit is not always where he is himself : some shape or vision of beauty seems to take possession of his thoughts with a power not to be escaped or postponed. His early and exclusive devotion to the chisel left him no time for any wide range of general reading; but his knowledge of the principles and history of art, and of the lives of the principles and history of art, and of the lives of eminent artists, is far greater than any but his intimate friends imagine.

The points of resem- blance are few; the points of difference many and marked. The Roman was stern, downright, and con- centrated ; the Italian is sensitive, impassioned, and expansive. The Romans had great organizing and aggregating power ; not only distributing the members of a single state in the harmonious degrees of civil of a single state in the harmonious degrees of civil society, but setting separate states into an imperial mosaic of symmetry and beauty. In modern Italian history we see vivid individual development more than combined force, and the fervid energies of isolated communities wasted in passionate struggles with each other. The hard and uniform Romans submitted them- selves to be bound together like the rods of the consu- lar fasces, but the sharper and more salient idiosyn- cracies of the Italians forbid such absorption. The interpretation of the Romans is found in law and order; of the Italians, in beauty and art. The Latin                       "

The Italian language is feminine, flexible, and elastic; soft as air and flowing as water; yielding to the finest touch and floating lightly round the most to the finest touch and floating lightly round the most aerial forms of fancy. Italian literature is full of rich invention, airy beauty, wild wit, gay humor, passionate feeling. It is playful, imaginative, tender, and gracé¬ ful. The change from ancient Rome to modern Italy, from strength to softness, and from power to emotion, from strength to softness, and from power to emotion, has suggested to Landor an image of great beauty. There tiny pleasures occupy the place Of glories and of duties ; as the feet Of fabled fairies, when the sun goes down, Trip o’er the grass where wrestlers strove by day. The Trasteverini, who dwell on the right bank of the Tiber, as is well known, claim to have a larger share of the Roman blood than their neighbors on the other side of the stream. They hold their heads higher and walk with larger strides, in that belief. In sober truth, there is very little to support their claim to the blood of old Rome, and still léss, to its spirit. These ex- citable and explosive people shew, in their boasting tongues and jealous tempers, that exaggeration of self, the freedom from which was the corner-stone of Ro- the freedom from which was the corner-stone of Ro- man greatness.

Their artists are wanting in ideal grace and depth of sentiment. The manly genius of the nation disdains the tricks and colors of rhetoric. Their common speech is abrupt; and their public discourse, plain, business-like, and conversational. A course of policy which all Chris- tendom waits to hear is announced by a badly-dressed gentleman, in a series of clumsy and fragmentary sen¬ tences, in which there is always good sense but not always good grammar.

They have the same liking for rough, athletic sports ; the same insen¬ same liking for rough, athletic sports ; the same insen¬ sibility to animal pain and suffering; and in their per- sonal habits, the same love of bathing — a taste which has quite died out upon the soil of Rome.

In Rome, there is an English church, an English reading- room, an English druggist, an English grocer, and an English tailor. As England is an island, so they every where form an insular community, upon which the waves of foreign influence beat in vain. This pecu¬ liarity penetrates to the individual.

Travellers of other nations learn to conform to the manners and customs of the people about them ; avoiding the observation attracted by sin¬ gularity. Not so the Englishman : he boldly faces the most bristling battery of comment and notice. His shooting jacket, checked trowsers, and brown gaiters proclaim his nationality before he begins to speak ; he rarely yields to the seduction of a moustache ; he is inflexibly loyal to tea; and will make a hard fight be- fore consenting to dine at an earlier hour than five. The English in Rome, as a general rule, shew little sensibility to the peculiar influences of the place. To¬ wards the Catholic Church and its ceremonies they turn à countenance of irreverent curiosity ; trying the spirit of the Italians by their careless deportment, their haughty strides, and their inveterate staring — intimat- ing that the forms of Catholic worship are merely dra- matic entertainments performed by daylight. Nor are they much moved by beauty, in nature or art. An Englishman, in his heart of hearts, regards emotion or enthusiasm as femine weaknesses, unworthy of man- enthusiasm as feminine weaknesses, unworthy of man- hood. A fine dog or horse calls forth from him more energetic admiration than the most beautiful landscape or picture. He marches through a gallery with reso- lute strides — his countenance expanding as the end draws near. Five minutes despatch a Raphael ; four, à Titian or Correggio; and two or three are enough for less illustrious names.

But the result is such as may well make a British heart swell with exulta- tion ; for now, on a fine breezy morning in December, the storm of an English fox-chase may be seen sweep- ing over the Campagna — huntsmen, whippers-in, earth-stoppers, and what not — with red-coated gen- tlemen that take leaps that make an Italian turn pale, and hounds whose deep bay is borne on the wind that waves the long grass on the Claudian aqueduct. What must have been the sensations of the first Roman fox, that looked forward to a quiet, domestic life, and to no worse fate than to be shot through the head by a peasant, when he found his dreams rudely shattered by these howling demons, and was forced to run for life across the fields he had so often traversed on a fearless trot ! An English fox seems born to and prepared for this inheritance ; but an Italian fox has had this destiny this inheritance ; but an Italian fox has had this destiny thrust upon him by perfidious Albion. Unhappy thrust upon him by  perfidious Albion. Unhappy foxes ! your day may come at last, when it will be your privilege, with hound and horn, to chase middle¬ aged gentlemen in red coats and white-top boots over some purgatorial Campagna. 1 have a distinct remembrance of a characteristic incident which I observed, on one occasion, before the Pope’s palace on the Quirinal.

A cir¬ cuitous line of some two or three miles in length had been marked out, over which the horses were to run; and by way of increasing the natural difficulties in the way, several artificial obstructions, in the shape of fences and ditches of various kinds, had been inter- posed. Some half a dozen horses, with riders in red jackets and buckskin breeches, started in the race. The whole course lay open to the eye ; but the distance was so considerable that the horses and their riders were shrunk to half the natural size. There was enough of danger in the enterprise to infuse a strong element of excitement into the minds of the spectators. The horses ran beautifully and took fearful leaps ; and both they and their riders met with serious falls ; but happily no bones were broken, though sometimes the men’s limbs seemed folded up like a carpenter’s rule. But luckily the soil of the Campagna is soft.

This staircase is often not closed at all, and is always kept open till a late hour. They are rarely lighted, except by a solitary lamp on the ground-floor ; so that provident persons usually carry à coil of wax-taper in the pocket, to be lighted at night before ascending.

The drawing-room was a spacious apartment of about thirty feet by twenty, handsomely carpeted and furnished. It had but one defect — it was difficult to keep it warm in damp and cold weather. The fire¬ place was ludicrously unsuited to perform the proper functions of a fireplace ; being a mere hole, or deep oven, scooped out of the chimney, at the end of which the fire nestled in modest obscurity.

From the drawing-room a door led into a small dining-room, and beyond the dining-room were three bedrooms opening into each other, with windows look- ing out upon the court-yard. These bedrooms were rather dark and cheerless in their aspect. Many things were wanting in finish, and shewed no very high stand¬ ard of material civilization. The hinges of the doors were not like ours, but like the bolts on which window¬ blinds are hung ; so that when the door was thrown back, it fell out of the perpendicular.

The inhabitants of Rome are divided into three classes or divisions ; the Trasteverini, who live on the right bank of the Tiber; the Monteggiani, who dwell on the hills; and the Popolanti, who occupy the low grounds of the Campus Martius and its neighborhood. It is said that a trained ear can detect peculiarities of speech and enunciation by which each is distinguished from the others. In general, the language is spoken in Rome with a fulness and metallic ring not usual in Rome with a fulness and metallic ring not usual among northern nations, and resembling the rich vo¬ calization of Italian singers. The mouth is opened more widely than at the north, and the volume of sound projected has more body and strikes more round¬ ly upon the ear. The letter R is ejaculated with great force. Milton, in his treatise on Education, makes an observation undoubtedly suggested by his own com- parison of the manner of speaking in Italy with that in England. “ For we Englishmen, being far northerly, in England. “ For we Englishmen, being far northerly, do not open our mouths in the cold air wide enough to grace a southern tongue ; but are observed by all to grace a southern tongue ; but are observed by all other nations to speak exceeding close and inward.'

The win¬ dows of the Corso in the Carnival were a new revela¬ tion to me on this head. The two points in Europe, where the rays of beauty converge to the most glitter- ing focus are, probably, the Roman carnival and the London opera house. The English and Roman women have a common resemblance in the fact that they are seen to the best advantage when seated. The features of the Roman women are generally regular, and the shape of the face more inclined to the square than the oval. The hair, rich, black, and full, is braided and knotted in a becoming and picturesque fashion. The forehead is low, broad, and firm; an- swering in its expression to the lower part of the face, which is massive and compact. The eye is large and finely set in its socket. The teeth, arms, and bust are fine; but the hands and feet, especially the latter, large; and the whole frame somewhat too sturdy and compact. The nose is large and almost 'invariably straight or aquiline. A clever Scotchwoman once re- marked, in a mixed party of Italians and English, that she and her countrymen looked like restored busts, with noses too small. The upper lip is often shaded with something more than the suspicion of a moustache. What is most wanting in the Roman women is an expression of softness, delicacy, and refinement. As the men there are like women, so the women are like the men there are like women, so the women are like men.

Passion and peril lay slumbering in their depths. It was a volcanic face, which, at a moment's warning, might break out in explosions of love, hatred, jealousy, or revenge. Thus Semiramis might have looked, while yet a shepherd’s daughter; or Charlotte Corday, while dreaming in the woods of Normandy, before the air-drawn dagger marshalled her the way to Paris.

Such a position was of peculiar importance to the first settlers of Rome, a band of outlaws and adventurers who held by the strong hand, and with whom might who held by the strong hand, and with whom might was right. There were two disadvantages, especially, in the spot on which Rome was founded; its swampy character made it unhealthy ; and it was liable to most disastrous inundations of the river. The Cloaca Maxi¬ ma is a proof, not only of the energies and resources of that early period, but of the urgent need which, of that early period, but of the urgent need which, from sanitary reasons, impelled to it.

MALARIA. Much has been written about the malaria of Rome, but the subject is not yet entirely clear ; and those in¬ quirers whose opinions are entitled to the most respect are not agreed as to the causes of the phenomena, the existence of which all admit. In such investigations, it is important to distinguish between the influences which is important to distinguish between the influences which are peculiar to Rome, and those which it shares with are peculiar to Rome, and those which it shares with other places similarly situated. The case may be thus briefly stated. Those exposures which ordinarily lead to colds or rheumatic attacks, in Rome, especially in the summer months, bring on intermittent fevers which easily assume a malignant type. There are some pe¬ culiarities in the climate of Rome and the way of life there, which expose young and incautious travellers to sudden changes of temperature. The climate itself is variable. Then, the difference between the sunny and the shady side of the street is very great. Sometimes the mere turning of a corner brings one into a tempera¬ ture many degrees lower or higher than that just left. Italians avoid the sunny side of the street in walking, in winter as well as in summer. The habit of making in winter as well as in summer. The habit of making excursions partly in a carriage and partly on foot, is dangerous. The churches and picture-galleries are                                "

If the adventurous traveller extends his researches further, and goes down into vaults, onibs, catacombs, and recent excavations, the danger arising from sudden changes of temperature becomes of course increased. But this danger, in its milder forms, can hardly be escaped at Rome ; for, in general, in passing out of the street into a house, the frame is in passing out of the street into a house, the frame is sensible of a slight chill. But, besides the above, there is in Rome, and espe¬ cially in its neighborhood, between the months of June and October, a certain deadly influence evolved from the soil, which strikes upon the exposed frame with the soil, which strikes upon the exposed frame with generally fatal effect. This morbific agency is most formidable after sunset, and seizes upon the system most strongly when in a state of sleep. This principle of disease is called out from the soil by the action of the sun, and produces effects similar in kind, though inferior in degree, to the fever and ague which pursues the new settlers in our country, wherever moist ground is exposed to the sun, and large masses of vegetable matter are left to decay. The subtle element of death eludes detection, because the nicest analysis fails to discover any different ingredients in the air of the most infected from that of the healthiest regions. Within the city, it is observed, as a general rule, but not without some exceptions, that the more tasteful and desirable the region is, the more dangerous is it during the infected season.

The lowest point is, l’aria pessima, then, l’aria cattiva, then, l’aria sospetta, then, l’aria sufficiente, then, l’aria buona, and lastly, l’ aria fina or ottima. Houses which lie in the cold shadow of a hill, so that the free circulation of air is impeded, are more unhealthy than those which have clear spaces all around them. Sometimes it happens that the houses on one side of a street are more healthy than those on the other. Such is said to be the case with the Via the other. Such is said to be the case with the Via Babuino. Even a difference is sometimes found be¬ tween the back and front apartments of the same house.                                   "

            "293 MALARIA. The principle of malaria, wafted through the air, seems to be in some measure arrested by material ob¬ structions. A range of hills often acts as a partial pro¬ tection. Piperno, for instance, is healthier than Sezza, though at a lower elevation ; because the former is separated from the Pontine marshes by a piece of rising ground. A screen of woods operates in the same man- ner. The cutting down of the extensive forests of pine which once bordered the seacoast of Latium, is be¬ lieved to have rendered the Campagna more unhealthy. Tournon relates, that the rumor of a project of cutting down a range of wood which protected Albano on the south alarmed the inhabitants so much that they went in crowds before the French authorities to protest against the measure. Sir George Head found a priest living with security in the neighborhood of the Palatine, upon a spot which had been abandoned for many years on account of its unhealthiness. He attributed its im¬ proved condition to a thriving grove of orange-trees. Superficial moisture is not a prominent source of ma¬ laria. The Campagna is, as a general rule, quite the reverse of a marshy or swampy tract, but resembles the downs of England or the prairies of our own coun¬ the downs of England or the prairies of our own coun¬ try. The draining of the Pontine marshes in the last century had no perceptible effect upon the health of Rome. It would seem that the exhalations forced up through the superficial soil, from lower strata of mois¬ ture, by the action of a powerful sun, are more deadly than the evaporation of water on the surface itself. The observation of the English army surgeons confirms this fact. It is the same in the fever and ague districts of our own country. The hot summers are those in                                  "

The monks of the mendicant orders, who wear, even in summer, a robe of thick woollen, are able to live unharmed in places where other persons are affected. Fire also acts as a dis¬ infectant. It is said that a person might sleep with impunity in the deadliest regions of the Campagna, in the sickliest season, by keeping a large fire burning in the chimney. It is a mistake to suppose that a too in the chimney. It is a mistake to suppose that a too generous and stimulating diet acts as a protection. In this as in similar forms of disease, an anxious and uneasy apprehension of evil is a disposing cause to its approach. Upon the whole, the facts in the case seem to war¬ rant the conclusion that the effects of the malaria in Rome and its neighborhood are not wholly to be ex- plained by general causes, such as operate in the many infected districts which are scattered over the globe; but that, in addition to these, there are certain influences peculiar to this particular locality. These last have been sought in the composition of the soil of the Cam¬ pagna, which is partly of marine and partly of volcanic origin; from which it is conjectured that gaseous ex¬ halations of peculiar malignity are forced from it by the action of the sun, and mingled with the atmospheric air. The researches of modern chemistry and the im proved methods of analysis now in use may throw some light upon this branch of the inquiry.                                 "

Rome gave birth only to Giacomo della Porta, Olivieri, Soria, Carlo Rainaldi, Antonio Rossi, Geronimo Teodoli, Nicholas Salvi, Luigi Vanvitelli; not one, of the first class. The oldest of these was Giacomo della Porta, and he was not born till 1543. In painting and sculpture the disproportion is still more curious. Of the painters, from Cimabue to Pompeo Battoni, the natives of Rome were Julio Ro¬ mano, Gaspar Poussin, Ciro Ferri, Francesco Trevisani, and Marco Benefiale ; the last three, very obscure names.

Claude Lorraine lived in Rome from his twenty- seventh year till his death in his eighty-second. Mengs passed the greater part of his life in Rome, and was never happy out of it.

Besides these, there are Thorwalsden, Overbeck, Gibson, Wolff, Crawford, Reinhart, Wagner, Dessoulavy, and many others, who, drawn to Rome as pilgrims and wayfarers, have bowed to the spell of her power, and remained there as sojourners and denizens. The great families of Rome are in like manner strangers to the soil : nearly all of them have owed their origin to their relationship to the ecclesiastics, their origin to their relationship to the ecclesiastics, who have from time to time been elevated to the tiara, A few claim to be descended from the old Roman families — Prince Massimi from the Fabii, for instance. How far such pretensions would be sanctioned by the authority of a college of antiquarian heralds may be well doubted.

Most of these are familiar sounds to strangers in Rome, from the palaces and villas with which their names are asso¬ ciated.

He was one of that class of men who combine great financial skill and shrewd business tact with a rough and coarse nature, and who in their prosperity are rather inclined to parade their in their prosperity are rather inclined to parade their roughness and coarseness as ornaments than hide them as defects. He had also a vein of biting humor, and used to enjoy in his cynical way the court paid to him by the old Roman nobility. The Roman nobility have no political influence, and no public career opened to them. The path of high public distinction can be entered only by those who embrace the ecclesiastical profession. This fre¬ quently adopted by younger sons, and with fair capa¬ city and character, they often reach the dignity of Cardinal. But of late years the noble Roman families have contributed fewer members to the church than was the custom formerly. At present, there are only two Cardinals in the sacred college who have sprung from papal families, Cardinal Barberini and Cardinal Altieri. Cardinal Odescalchi, a few years since, re¬ signed the purple and entered the order of the Jesuits. Being thus without any high career to quicken his powers and elevate his ambition, the Roman noble¬ man, unless he have literary or scientific tastes, must take refuge in a life of frivolous indolence or profligate self-indulgence.

We may easily imagine the rapture with which Sir Walter Scott would have poun¬ ced upon such a treasure-trove, in the prime of his powers; and with such materials, a novelist of half his genius might easily earn a brilliant and enduring repu¬ tation. Such themes would present all the elements of startling adventure, picturesque description, and thrill¬ ing incident. The scene would change from the peo¬ pled splendor of Roman palaces to the savage solitudes of secluded castles in the wooded glens and on the bare crags of the Apennines. Nobles, ecclesiastics and soldiers would mingle in the mazy dance of events with artists and scholars; and, mixed with these, the with artists and scholars; and, mixed with these, the hired bravo and the female poisoner would stalk or flit across the stage and suddenly disappear. Great his¬ torical names could be introduced with no violation of probability, and around the whole the dazzling lights and hues of romance could be poured. That the an¬ nals of the great Roman families are so prolific in romantic matter is to be ascribed, partly to the subtle and passionate character of the Italians, which inclines them alike to crimes of treachery and violence ; and partly to the fact that the nobility of Italy in the mid¬ dle ages lived in defiance alike of law and public opinion, to an extent to which English history, since                                 "

The great families had almost absolute dominion, not stopping short of life and death, within their own fiefs; and some fragments of their former feudal privileges yet remain. The fearful tragedy of the Cenci, so well known through the power of painting and poetry, is one of these domestic histories; and perhaps if all the horrors now slumbering in manuscript in mouldering cabinets and forgotten crypts were revealed to the light of day, it would not be found to be the darkest. That mysterious personage, Lucrezia Borgia, over whose motives and character so much dust of learned con- troversy has been raised, is another and representative character in Italian domestic history. Reumont, in his Neue Rœmische Briefe,' relates a tragic story drawn from the annals of the Savelli family, which fearfully illustrates the fatal consequences which spring from the collision of fervid passions. I have merely abridged his narrative. About the middle of the sixteenth century, the Duke of Savelli had an only son who, from his mental and personal graces, was the object of great admiration to his friends and relatives, and of a doting affection to his parents. A marriage was negotiated for him with the daughter of a noble Neapolitan house, who was to bring him a dowry of eight hundred thousand scudi; but on account of the tender age of the bride the nup¬ tial ceremony was to be delayed for some time.

The young woman was possessed of firmness and principle, as were her parents. She was kept concealed in the house so that the young nobleman could neither speak to nor communicate with her; his presents were returned ; and the marriage with Christoforo hastened as fast as possible. After the marriage, the infatuated lover still continued his persecuting attentions; wrote letter after letter; and even hired a house next to that in which the married pair lived, in order that he might see and speak with the wife from the window — a step which compelled them to change their abode. Although the young wife behaved with great propriety, and revealed to her husband all the annoyances to which she was to her husband all the annoyances to which she was exposed — giving him her whole heart and her whole confidence — his mind was tortured with jealousy, sus¬ picion, and fear; the more so as the passion of his liege lord was now matter of common notoriety all over the village. He grew at last into such a state of desperation that he resolved to bring things to an end, no matter at what cost. As his wife shewed him all the letters she received from Savelli— and as these the letters she received from Savelli— and as these grew more and more passionate and importunate, and began to assume a threatening tone — he at last com¬ pelled her to write to her persecutor at his dictation, telling him that her husband would soon leave home on business, and that she would then sec him at her house.

He was cautiously admitted and conducted into an inner apartment where Christoforo was seated, dressed in female attire.

Towns, over-ripe with age, crowning the tops of steep hills, as if they had been dropped upon them from the clouds : feudal towers, rusting away like pieces of disused armor; aqueducts and bridges with the stamp of Roman greatness upon them ; and walls black with Etrurian shadows — offered themselves to the eye when it turned away from the eternal forms of Nature ; and over the whole landscape there hung a charm not dis- cerned by the eye — a spirit of power and beauty¬ which gave a voice to every stream that broke upon the solitude, and dignity to every mountain shadow This interest was not derived from the struggles and dramatic changes of the middle ages alone — not alone from the grandeur and decay of Rome — but in part from the fortunes of those mysterious Etrurians, whose civilization had passed the culminating point before the seeds of Rome had been planted. And how vivid was the contrast between this mighty past, running up to an unrecorded morning twilight, and the freshness of the actual landscape, just breaking into the verdure and bloom of spring, and exulting in the sense of new-born                                  "

Between the post stations there would fre- quently be many miles with hardly a sign of human habitation, and but for a town or village set upon a dis¬ tant hill, we might have supposed ourselves in some new region just opened to the stream of population and enterprise. There was no succession of farm-houses and modest hamlets, each within an easy call of some other, but after passing out of the towns which, from the compactness of their streets and the height and the compactness of their streets and the height and close proximity of the houses, seemed like pieces cut out of a large city, every thing was solitary and deso¬ late, as if the land had been wasted by pestilence or ravaged by war. 1 have spoken often, perhaps too often, of the beauty and variety of Italian scenery, and my only apology is to be found in the ever new pleasure which it awakened. The most striking effects of scenery are produced when elements unlike in the impression-they make are brought into immediate comparison and rela¬ tion. A level plain stretching away to the horizon every side is well enough to see for a while, but its continuance soon wearies the eye. But let a range of mountains loom up in the distance, and a new charac¬ ter is given to the intermediate plain. So when a ter is given to the intermediate plain. So when a mountain rises up abruptly from a level region, like Soracte, the mountain is the finer for the plain, and the plain for the mountain. It is the same with lakes. The most striking are those which are the deepest set, like Como, or still more, Lucerne. The overhanging cliff and the liquid floor take and give beauty and gran¬                                  "

Mountains themselves which are packed closely together, with only deep fissure-like valleys between them, are shorn of half their power from the want of a proper element of comparison. One of the felicities of the scenery of Cumberland Westmoreland in Eng- land, and which gives such effect to their low and bare mountains, is that the spaces between them are broad level plains of lake or meadow, from which the hills rise up like trees from a smooth lawn. The character of Italian scenery is mainly determined by the central chain of the Apennines and its lateral spurs, and the comparatively narrow strip of level region between the mountains and the sea. Nor is this all ; for the inter¬ mediate space has been the scene of powerful volcanic action, which always results in picturesque contrasts. Thus, in Italy, south of the great alluvial plain of Lom¬ bardy and away from the immediate seacoast, the eye is never discontented with monotony. Standing upon is never discontented with monotony. Standing upon a height, there is always a wide horizon to look down a height, there is always a wide horizon to look down upon ; and travelling over a plain, there are always heights to look up to. The streams rush rapidly through narrow and precipitous banks. The lakes oc- cupy the craters of extinct volcanoes. Deep wooded glens open on all sides, in which rocks and trees group themselves into the finest combinations. The travel¬ ler’s path is full of variety, and the beauty that pitches her tents before him as he moves, never appears twice in the same garb. From Narni I went on to Terni, through a beautiful valley embosomed in high hills.

These celebrated falls did not correspond to the ex¬ pectations 1 had formed of them. They seemed to me to have been be-rhymed and be-prosed beyond their deserts. Poets and travellers who have described them dwell upon their terrors and sublimities — as if a mighty power were put forth, before which the mind of man must needs stand in fear and trembling. The answer to such claims is found in the facts that the Velino is only about fifty feet wide, and that the falls themselves are artificial. Brockedon, who has given an excellent view of the scene, speaks of the appalling effect of the view of the scene, speaks of the  appalling effect of the cataract.' I cannot conceive of the most sensitive nerves being ’appalled’ here, any more than before a city water-spout in a hard rain. The falls did not seem to me sublime, hardly grand ; but worthy of all praise for their beauty and grace. The form of the cliff over for their beauty and grace. The form of the cliff over which the water flows is very fine ; as is the character of the whole scenery through which the stream flows. The rocks are scooped and hollowed in the most becom- ing shapes ; trees and shrubs grow just where they are wanted ; there is water enough to give animation to the whole scene ; and great variety results from the dif¬ ferent inclinations over which the stream breaks and glides. The cataract would be perfect in its way were the waters clear, which was far from being the case the waters clear, which was far from being the case when 1 saw them: they were of a dirty yellow, and the silver of their foam seemed tarnished and rusty. the silver of their foam seemed tarnished and rusty.

The next morning, by virtue of an arrangement pre¬ viously concluded, I was driven over from Terni to San Gemini, a small village about ten miles off, in order to take a diligence which passed through there on the way to Perugia ; and, to make sure of the time, I was obliged to start at five.

There were very few houses on the road, but we met many laborers, some singly and some in groups, going out to their daily toil. San Gemini is a very small village, as is usual in Italy, resembling the street of a city ; being composed of two rows of high stone houses, and when you come of two rows of high stone houses, and when you come to the end of them the open country begins. I waited an hour for the lazy diligence, but I passed it very pleasantly in walking about the town and its outskirts, watching the ways of the people, and endeavoring to establish diplomatic relations with some very young gentlemen and ladies, whose mothers had brought them out into the morning light. There was a small café, crowded with men in coarse working dresses, each of whom took a small cup of black coffee before going out to his labor. Two old men sat down in a corner to play cards: it is my firm faith that a dirtier pack could not at that moment have been found upon earth. Near them was a segretario, or letter-writer, just finish- ing a letter for a very rough-looking contadino, who ing a letter for a very rough-looking contadino, who dug his words out very slowly, and seemed troubled in spirit. The people looked poor but contented. Nearly every person saluted me as I passed, and in the little café thère was a quiet tone of good manners and an absence of rude staring, such as was hardly to be ex- pected in a place where strange faces were probably not very common.

Not a human being but myself was in sight. The body was dressed precisely as the woman would have been if living, in a gown of blue stuff, with stockings and stout shoes.

The diligence plodded on slowly to Todi, over a hilly road, but through a country so beautiful that no one could have wished to be whirled rapidly through it. The air was elastic and bracing, and the sky covered with massive clouds of snowy white, which the light winds hardly stirred. Todi, high in the air, shone like an aerial city, and was visible for some hours before we an aerial city, and was visible for some hours before we reached it. It is a little provincial town of about thrée thousand inhabitants; and it is curious to compare such a place with a town of similar size in New England, a place with a town of similar size in New England, both in what it has and what it has not. In Todi it would probably be a difficult thing to pick up a news- paper or a periodical ; and a library of twenty volumes in the possession of a layman would be an extraordi- nary phenomenon in such a place.

There is also another church, with a Gothic doorway covered with a rich and elaborate carving, such as could not be paralleled in the whole United States. Such is Italy; rich in art, but poor in thought and action — rich in the bequests of the past, but poor in the harvests of the present. Between Todi and Perugia the road passes through a level region, under fine cultivation. Perugia was a level region, under fine cultivation. Perugia was distinctly visible for so long a time before we reached it, and the distance between us and it seemed so little diminished by the progress we made, that I began to think it was a city in a dream which kept receding as we drew near.

Few persons have any notion of how in¬ teresting a city this is, and how rich in works of art; to say nothing of its glorious situation, and clean, quiet, aristocratic-looking streets, so utterly without business or bustle. I had the advantage of delicious weather, with a transparent atmosphere which made the distant near, and pushed the horizon so far off as to include a boundless range of mountain, hill, and valley. Stratford-on-Avon is hardly more identified with Shakespeare, than is Perugia with the admirable artist to whom it has given the name by which he is com¬ monly known. I call him admirable, for so he is in his best works, but there is a great space between his best and his worst works. Sometimes he is almost equal to Raphael, and sometimes he is far below himself. So far as we can judge from what we know of his life though I cannot help distrusting some of Vasari’s state- ments — he seems to have been one of those men whose genius derives no elements of growth from the charac¬ ter. His early years were darkened with poverty and struggle : his temperament was not hopeful, nor were his manners engaging. The remembrance of his suf¬ his manners engaging. The remembrance of his suf¬ ferings and privations gave him an undue estimate of the value of money, and when success came, he es¬ teemed it less for the sphere of development which it opened than for the means of accumulating property which it furnished.

With the help of his pupils he painted an immense number of pictures, which were dispersed through the galleries of Europe, which have just merit enough to make one vexed that they have not more. Every one remembers the remark of the would-be connoisseur in the Vicar of the remark of the would-be connoisseur in the Vicar of Wakefield, that the secret of his art consisted in two rules : ’The one, always to observe that the picture might have been better if the painter had taken more pains; and the other, to praise the works of Pietro Perugino.’ In a multitude of cases, these two rules might be put in practice before the same picture. No artist has painted more pictures of which it may be said with truth, that they would have been better if the painter had taken more pains. And, at best, he wants variety and dramatic power. When he has many figures to deal with, he does not group them with skill and judgment. He is also deficient in manly grasp and vigorous energy, and there is feminine weakness and vigorous energy, and there is feminine weakness as well as feminine delicacy in his pencil.

His coloring is soft, rich, and mellow ; remarkable for its harmonious gradations and purity of tone.

The sentiment of worship especially the devotional instinct which naturally bends the head the devotional instinct which naturally bends the head forward, as a tree is swayed by the wind — is always conspicuous in his pictures. It is difficult to believe the stories that are told of his irreligion, when we look upon the rapt and glowing heads of his saints and madonnas. I began my day at Perugia by a visit to the cathe¬ dral, but could only observe the general effect of the interior, for it was under repair and the pictures were not visible. The frescoes of the Sala del Cambio, or Hall of Exchange, are perhaps the culminating point of the painter’s genius. Nowhere else does he put forth so much power, dignity, and variety. On one side, are several Sybils and Prophets, with the Almighty in glory above them ; and on the other, various per¬ sonages of Greek and Roman history, arranged in groups; and, above them, allegorical figures of the virtues which distinguished them. On the wall, oppo¬ site the entrance, are the Transfiguration and the Na¬ tivity — both very fine, the latter especially. The roof is covered with beautiful arabesques, and figures repre¬ senting the seven planets, with Apollo in the centre. In this room there is a portrait of Perugino himself, which is a harder and coarser face than one would have supposed from his works. In these frescoes, Peru¬ gino was assisted by Raphael, whose likeness is said to be preserved in the figure of the prophet Daniel. The church of S. Agostino has two works by Peru- gino, one representing the Nativity, and the other, the Baptism of the Saviour.

It is in two compartments, or divisions, an upper and lower. In the former, is God the Father with two child angels, each holding a sort of floating scroll. This por- tion is much injured.

This upper church, though Gothic in its forms, is not Gothic in its gloom; but, on the contrary, is filled with glowing and brilliant light, through which the fading forms of saints and apostles strike upon the eye with strange power. It is much less crowded than most Italian churches, and a silence like that of the grave broods over its spaces.

To move along this re¬ gion, and through these quaint, sleepy, venerable places, with their walls, their towers, their gates, and their churches, is like reading a leaf out of the chronicle of Villani, or the Divina Commedia of Dante. Nor is this pleasure to be purchased by any thing more than trifling discomforts and inconveniences. The inns are at least decent, and the food tolerable. Let me also give my willing testimony in favor of the people; for I had met with uniform courtesy and civility, and no one had attempted to overreach or overcharge me.

When I compared my last impressions of the Italians with my first, I felt that I had taken one lesson more on the rashness of hasty judgments.

Engravings and descriptions have made the situation of Genoa familiar even to those who have not seen it. It is a cluster of palaces, of brilliant white, crowded together at the base of a mountain of semicircular form, the sides of which are dotted with gay, suburban villas. The sweeps and curves of the hollow, crescent¬ shaped mountain are in animated contrast with the level of the Mediterranean, and the brilliant white of the houses is distinctly brought out by the dark back- the houses is distinctly brought out by the dark back- ground behind and above them. All this was very beautiful as it gradually glowed into day and put on the imperial robes of morning, but when the first shock of surprise and pleasure had passed by, I could not help feeling how very small it all was.

But the gems of the whole collection are the portraits of the Marquis and Marchioness Brignole Sale, which hang opposite to each other in one of the rooms. The Marquis on horseback, a noble figure, dressed in black, with his hat in his right hand the reins in his left; the face and form full of dignity and grace; every inch a gentleman. The Marchioness is a full-length figure, in rather an awkward dress of a full-length figure, in rather an awkward dress of black, with a large, disfiguring ruff, a feather fastened into the hair at the back of the head; and a rose in her hand. This one of the most beautiful portraits ever painted. There is a winning sweetness and softness in the expression of the eyes, and a light bloom plays the expression of the eyes, and a light bloom plays round the cheeks and the lips which seem just ready to break into a smile. She stands before you so full of rich, warm life — so breathing an image of youth and grace and sweetness— that it is hard to believe that all that remains of so rare a piece of well-formed earth? that remains of so rare a  piece of well-formed earth? is but a handfull of dust. The picture is as fresh as is but a handfull of dust. The picture is as fresh as if the painter were just cleaning his brushes after the last touch had been given to it, and one expects to hear a door open and catch the light step and rustling silk of the fair original. Its fascination is indescriba¬ ble, and I found it hard to leave the room in which it hangs. There is a certain degree of companionship in an animated portrait of any one who has really lived, beyond what we feel in looking at an ideal head; not only from the help which the imagination gives, but because ideal heads rarely have the sharp individu¬ ality of portraiture; and when the truth of the repre-                                  "

To me, there is something profoundly touching in the pictured face of youth and beauty that lived and died two or three centuries ago. It brings together, in such vivid contrast, the mortal nature of the subject, and the immortal power of the mind which grasped and arrested it. It is the most striking commentary upon the text that life is short and art is long. The glowing face and the cunning and art is long. The glowing face and the cunning hand have long been dust, but both live upon the breathing canvas to proclaim at once thé power of genius and the power of beauty.

PILGRIMAGES. THE earliest travellers in Italy were pilgrims. The stream of devotional feeling, after the approach to Jerusalem became too difficult or too dangerous, was diverted to Rome, the second city in the Christian heart? Men of this class did not, as we may suppose, usually travel with a pen in the hand. The industrious research of Mabillon has, however, brought to light the journal of one of these religious travellers, a resident of Einsiedeln in Switzerland, who visited Rome in the ninth century. His journal, published by Mabillon in his Analecta, is said to be of some value in an antiqua¬ rian point of view, especially upon some topographical details, but it contains no record of personal feeling, * In the preparation of this chapter and the two others which follow it, I have been occasionally indebted to an essay in the miscellaneous writings of M.

Gibbon, in one of the closing chapters of his in 1294. Gibbon, in one of the closing chapters of his great work, has described, in his striking and condensed manner, the first of these jubilees or holy years, in 1300, and the motives which induced the pontiff to take the step. His bull, dated February 22, 1300, granted plenary indulgence to all persons who, being truly re¬ pentant, and having confessed their sins, should visit once a day, during thirty days, the churches of the apostles Peter and Paul. To strangers, the number of days was lessened to fifteen. Hardly was the ink of the papal bull dry, when its call was answered by an innumerable stream of pilgrims, who flocked to Rome from all parts of Italy, Germany, France, and England. Villani, the Florentine historian, who was one of this devout company, computes that during the whole of the vear there was no time in which there were not at r least two hundred thousand strangers in Rome. A far greater Florentine than Villani, Dante, was also there, and a vivid ray from his genius has fallen upon one of the scenes which he witnessed, and made it immor¬ tal. The bridge of St. Angelo, in order to accommo¬ date the immense multitudes that were passing to and fro upon it, had been divided lengthwise by a partition, so that all who were going in the same direction might keep on one side. The poet compares the mournful files of sinners in the eighth circle of the Inferno to the crowds which he had seen upon this bridge. He also dates his poem from the year of the jubilee.                                    "

The jubilee of 1350 caused a general movement throughout Europe, equal to that of 1300. It occurred during the career of Rienzi, and in the interval between his first success and his last and short-lived elevation. his first success and his last and short-lived elevation. More than a million of strangers visited Rome during the year, although a rainy spring, succeeding a very cold winter, had broken up the roads and made travel¬ ling difficult and dangerous. The people of Rome, unchecked by any strong hand of authority, plundered the poor pilgrims, without conscience or mercy, through the exorbitant prices which they required for all articles the exorbitant prices which they required for all articles of necessity ; and when the cardinal-legate, from a wish to shorten the stay of the strangers, gave them some new indulgences, the citizens attacked his palace, killed several of his servants, and foreed him to leave the city. The crowd of devout worshippers in Rome was so great, that no great ceremonial of religion took place without several persons being crushed to death. Since that period the jubilee has taken place every twenty-five.years, and on these occasions the number of strangers in Rome is unusually large, though very                                  "

The great concourse of foreigners in Rome during these years has led to the foundation of those national churches and hospitals which are among the peculiar features of this city. Thus, the Spaniards built the church and hospital of St. James; the French, those of St. Louis; the Lombards, of St. Ambrose ; the Portuguese, of St. Antony ; and there are many others of the same class and origin. The pilgrims were re¬ ceived and entertained for three days, gratuitously, at these foundations, and they were sure of finding aid and protection there during the whole period of their residence. PETRARCH — POGGIO BRACCIOLINI. Petrarch was the earliest among the writers in mod¬ ern literature, to look at Rome with that feeling, partly scholarlike and partly imaginative, which has since inspired so many books. In his day the papal court was at Avignon, and Rome was in the lowest stage of was at Avignon, and Rome was in the lowest stage of desolation and disorder. The population was said to have sunk to the number of seventeen thousand, though this hardly credible. The remains of antiquity, and even the structures of more recent periods, were aban¬ doned to neglect, or exposed to violence. The heart of Petrarch was moved as a patriot, a poet, and a scholar. In many portions of his writings, and his let¬ ters, he breathes the impassioned sorrow which the condition of Rome naturally called forth. To the pope Urban V. he writes in the following energetic strain : In your absence there is neither repose nor content ;                                "

But with what heart, O good Father, pardon me this boldness, can you slumber softly on the banks of the Rhone, under the gilded roofs of your chambers, while the Lateran is falling to ruin, and this mother of all the churches, stripped of its roof, is exposed to the winds and rains — while the sanctuaries of Peter and Paul are tottering to their fall, and that which was once their temple, is now a heap of ruins, a mass of shape¬ less stones, such as would wring compassion from a heart of stone?’ In another place, he complains of the ignorance of the people of Rome of their own history, and says that Rôme is nowhere so little known as in Rome itself. But, as Bunsen remarks, his own know- ledge of antiquity was any thing but exact, and the reflections which its remains call forth are the splendid declamations of a poetical enthusiast, who would not wish to be disabused of a pleasing delusion. Thus, he calls the Pyramid of Cestius, the Monument of Remus — at that time the traditionary name among the com¬ mon people — in spite of the inscription so visible on its walls.

Gibbon, in the last chapter of his history, has quoted somé eloquent passages on the ruins of Rome, from à Latin essay, De fortunæ varietate,' by the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini. He was one of the in¬ tellectual lights of Italy in the first half of the fifteenth century — a man of great activity of mind and variety of attainments — like many of the scholars of that pe¬ of attainments — like many of the scholars of that pe¬ riod, not always leading a reputable life, and sometimes writing lines which, whether living or dying, he should have wished to blot. These extracts are written with true feeling and much energy of expression, and Bunsen remarks in his learned preface to the Beschreibung der Stadt Rom, that his observation was accurate, and that we owe to him some valuable information as to the we owe to him some valuable information as to the state of Rome in his time, which would otherwise have been wholly wanting. LUTHER. Petrarch and Poggio, Italians, scholars, and men of genius, felt themselves in some measure at home, even in Rome. They beheld it with the eye of taste and learning only, and have recorded none of the impres¬ sions which its religious aspect may have made upon them. But a man of a very different stamp came to Italy in the early part of the sixteenth century. Martin Luther was in Rome in the year 1510, having been VOL. II. 23                                  "

SHAKESPEARE. The question whether Shakespeare ever visited Italy is one of those literary curiosities which has been some- what discussed of late years. Mr. Charles Armitage Brown, in an ingenious essay on the autobiographical poems of the great poet, published in 1838, maintains the affirmative of the proposition with much zeal ; and the probability of it is admitted in some of the notes to the Italian plays in Knight’s pictorial edition. Mr. Brown comes to this conclusion, partly because it was the general custom at that time for cultivated English¬ men, whose fortunes would allow of it, to travel in Italy, and because Shakespeare’s means were sufficient for such an indulgence, and partly from the superior know- ledge of Italian customs and localities shewn in the later Italian plays, such as The Taming of the Shrew and The Merchant of Venice, as compared with The Two Gentlemen of Verona. It is certainly true that Shakespeare, in his Italian plays, shews an extensive and minute acquaintance with Italian life, manners, localities, occupations, and amusements. Lady Mor¬ gan remarks, that there is not a single article of furni¬ ture which Gremio describes as being in his house in Padua, which she has not herself seen in some one in Padua, which she has not herself seen in some one or other of the palaces of Florence, Venice, or Genoa; or other of the palaces of Florence, Venice, or Genoa; and Mr. Brown confirms the truth of this statement from his own observation.

And in the next place, his knowledge of Italy may be explained without a visit to the country. The old notion of Shakespeare’s having been a wild, irregular genius, with no help from books and study, is long since ex¬ ploded by modern research and modern criticism. There is little doubt that he understood the Italian language, and we may be sure that in the preparation of his Italian plays, he read every book illustrative of the subject, on which he could lay his hands. His intuitive perception of historical truth, the astonishing sagacity with which he seizes upon every trait which is distinguishing and characteristic, and the vitality which his genius breathes into his knowledge, are as remark- his genius breathes into his knowledge, are as remark- able in his Greek and Roman plays, as in those in which the scene is laid in modern Italy. On the whole, Shakespeare’s visit to Italy stands much upon the same footing in point of evidence, as that of the Northmen to New England before Columbus. It is certainly possi- ble, perhaps probable ; but it remains to be proved. It is pleasant to think of Shakespeare’s swimming in a gondola, and to believe that the beautiful pictures in The Merchant of Venice and Othello were recollec- tions, and not imaginations ; that Belmont was a pa¬                                  "

ASCHAM. The learned Roger Ascham, who went to Germany about the middle of the sixteenth century as secretary to Sir Richard Morysine, the English ambassador, made a flying visit of only nine days into Italy. Most of this short period appears to have been spent in Ven¬ ice. In his Schoolmaster,' written some years later, he alludes to this passage in his life, and makes it the text and starting-point for a furious tirade upon the vices of Italy and the corrupting influence which that country had exerted upon the morals, manners, and literature of England. Indeed, he speaks of the sin which he himself saw, in that brief space of time, as being so great, that one cannot but suspect that he must have gone out of his way, and taken some pains to find it. His observations have no other value than such as is derived from one or two facts which he does not so much state as assume. One of these is, that it was at that time the fashion for young Englishmen, of birth and fortune, to complete their education by a tour in Italy ; and another is, that many ’ fond’ (that is, fool¬ ish) books had recently been translated out of Italian into English, over which the good Roger groans in spirit. “Ten sermons at Paul’s Cross do not so much good for moving men to true doctrine, as one of these                                "

Another argument which he uses against visiting Italy sounds rather odd from English lips. He com¬ plains of the freedom of thought and speech which prevails in the cities of Italy, both in religion and politics, and that young men, who have been accus¬ tomed to this liberty, come home less inclined to be good subjects and good Protestants. good subjects and good Protestants. MILTON. In 1638, Milton went to Italy. He was at that time thirty years old, and had been living for some years in studious retirement; probably the happiest period of his life, undisturbed by domestic troubles or political controversy, and dedicated to the highest intellectual labors and delights. He had in this interval published Comus,’ * L’Allegro,’ and ’Il Penseroso;’ but, strange to say, they had attracted comparatively little notice, and he was yet not much known beyond the circle                                "

He wrote and spoke both the Latin and Italian languages with idiomatic ease and elegance, and was perfectly familiar with the history and literature of both Rome and Italy. His person was beautiful, his manners graceful, and he was skilled in all the manly exercises of his time ; he had also inherited from his father a natural taste for music, in which art Italy was then in advance of the rest of Europe. It is not to be wondered at this handsome young Englishman, so full of learning, genius, and accomplishments, speaking and writing their own language so perfectly, should have been received by the susceptible Italians with an enthusiasm such as he never inspired in his own country at any period of his life. He passed into Italy by way of Paris, Nice, and Genoa. He remained two months in Florence, min- gling in the learned society of that place, and receiving many marks of distinction from its scholars. While here he visited Galileo, who was then living at Arcetri, in the immediate vicinity of Florence, under the eye in the immediate vicinity of Florence, under the eye of the Inquisition, though not actually a prisoner. From Florence he passed to Sienna and thence to Rome, where he resided also two months, much ca- ressed by the most distinguished society there. He then continued his journey to Naples, where he became acquainted with Manso, Marquis of Villa, a soldier and scholar, well known as the friend, patron, and biogra- pher of Tasso, and who has secured a place in English literature by the beautiful epistle in Latin verse                                  "

From Na¬ ples he purposed passing over to Sicily and Greece; but, on hearing of the commencement of the troubles between the king and the parliament of England, he set his face homeward. He returned to Rome, where he spent two more months; visited Florence and Lucca; he spent two more months; visited Florence and Lucca; and crossing the Apennines, went by the way of Bologna and Ferrara to Venice, where he remained a month. From Venice he took his course through a month. From Venice he took his course through Verona, Milan, and along Lake Leman, to Geneva; and then home, through France; having been absent about fifteen months. It is rather curious that Milton should not have re¬ corded any of the impressions which such a country as Italy must have made upon him. It does not even appear that he kept a diary. With what interest should we learn that such a manuscript had been discovered, and how precious a memorial it would be of that bright period of his life! And it is also quite remarkable how little there is in his subsequent writings which seems to have sprung directly from his Italian tour, and to have been distinctly drawn from the images and impressions then gathered up. Critics are at great pains to trace this or that picture or expression in the Paradise Lost to some painting, statue, or scene in Italy ; but the faint¬ ness of the resemblance fails to bring conviction to the mind. With the exception of the well-known allusions in the first book of the Paradise Lost to the woods of Vallombrosa, and to the astronomer in Fiesolé or Val¬ darno, there is hardly a line which would prove incon- testably that the poet’s foot had ever been upon the soil                                  "

And yet no one can doubt that the art, the scenery, and the antiquities of that country must have sunk deep into his mind, and filled it with images which rose up in his hours of solitude and blindness with soothing and refreshing influence. He doubtless saw much there which offended his puritan zeal, always an active principle in his nature, however mellowed by classical studies. It is difficult to imagine Milton, at any period of his life, in a Romish church, without a frown upon his brow. He has expressly recorded that he gave offence, and incurred some danger, by the freedom with which he spoke upon religious subjects, and in his grotesque description of the paradise of fools in the third book of the Paradise Lost, there are some touches of sarcasm doubtless supplied by the ceremo¬ nials of the church which he had witnessed at Rome. The same recollections also gave earnestness and point to the vigorous invective with which, in his prose writ¬ ings, he so often assails the abuses of prelacy and the corruptions of the church. EVELYN. Within three or four years after Milton’s return to England, the pure-minded and accomplished John Evelyn, that model of an English gentleman, visited Italy, and indeed resided there nearly three years. He left England at the age of twenty-three, and it curiously illustrates the difference between his temperament and that of Milton, that the troubles between the king and the parliament which called the one home sent the other abroad.

Evelyn mentions him again, in his account of St. Peter’s, and says that a short time before his arrival at Rome, the artist gave a public opera, ’ wherein he painted the scenes, cut the statues, invented the en¬ gines, composed the music, writ the comedy, and built the theatre.' Evelyn visited the Villa Ludovisi, where the statue of the Dying Gladiator then was ; and also the Villa Medici, in which at that time were the Venus the Villa Medici, in which at that time were the Venus de Medici, the Wrestlers, the Knife-Whetter, and the Apollino, all of which have long been in Florence.

His letters, addressed to his father, his mother, and his friend West, contain lively and ani¬ mated sketches of what he saw, written in easy and graceful prose, quite unlike the rich elaboration of his poetry. His first impression of Rome seems rather overwrought, and probably in the flutter of spirits into which a person of so much genius and so much learn- ing must have been thrown on such an occasion, he drew more from what he felt than from what he actu- ally saw. The first entrance of Rome is prodigiously striking.  It is by a noble gate, designed by Michael Angelo, and adorned with statues; this brings you into a large square, in the midst of which is a large obelisk of granite, and in the front you have at one view two churches of a handsome architec- ture, and so much alike that they are called the twins; with three streets, the middlemost of which is one of the largest in Rome. As high as my expectation was raised, I confess, the magnificence of this city infinitely surpasses it. You cannot pass along a street but you have views of some palace, or church, or square, or fountain, the most picturesque and noble one can imagine.

IN the autumn of 1764, Smollett, who had been for some months previous a resident of Nice, on account of his health, made a short excursion into Italy. He had left England in the summer of 1763 with a consti¬ tution broken by the toils of a literary life, and spirits deeply depressed by the death of a beloved daugh- ter, an only child, in the fifteenth year of her age. He set out from Nice early in September, and returned to it before Christmas, running rapidly over that portion of the peninsula which lies south of the Apennines of the peninsula which lies south of the Apennines and between Genoa and Rome. His travels are prob- and between Genoa and Rome. His travels are prob- ably more known by the sarcasms of Sterne, who, in his * Sentimental Journey’ ridicules Smollett under the name of Smelfungus, than by their own merits or the name of Smelfungus, than by their own merits or defects. The strictures of Sterne are not undeserved. Smollett was a man of an extremely irritable tempera¬ ment; sudden in quarrel, though placable ; of lofty self-esteem ; and inclined to suspicion. These infirmi¬ ties had been aggravated by the wretched life he had                       "

His journal is, for the most part, an unattractive record of annoy¬ ances and discomforts, marked by considerable energy of expression, but wearisome from its sameness. With innkeepers, ostlers, and postilions, especially, he seems to have been in a state of perpetual war; and he fell into so many quarrels with them that the wonder is. considering the revengeful and vindictive character of the lower class of Italians, that he ever got out of the country alive. He is every where devoured by ver- min, poisoned with bad food, and pillaged by extor- tionate landlords. Indeed, making all allowances for his diseased state of mind and body, travelling in Italy at that period must have been a very uncomfortable at that period must have been a very uncomfortable experience, requiring patience, animal spirits, and a well-stocked purse to make it at all endurable. Here, for instance, are some of his records between Rome and Florence : From Perugia to Florence the posts are all double, and the road is so bad, that we never could travel above eight¬ and-twenty miles a day. We were often obliged to quit the carriage, and walk up steep mountains; and the way in gen¬ eral was so unequal and stony, that we were jolted even to the danger of our lives. I never felt any sort of exercise or fatigue so intolerable ; and I did not fail to bestow an hun¬ dred benedictions per diem upon the banker, Barazzi, by whose advice we had taken this road.

Next day one of the irons of the coach gave way at Arezzo, where we were detained two hours before it could be accommodated. 1 might have taken this opportunity to view the remains of the ancient Etruscan amphitheatre, and the temple of Hercules, described by the cavalier Lorenzo Guazesi, as standing in the neighborhood of this place ; but the blacksmith assured me his work would be finished in a few minutes; and as I had nothing so much at heart as the speedy accomplishment of this disagreeable journey, I chose to suppress my curiosity, rather than be the occasion of a moment’s delay. But all the nights we had hitherto passed were comfortable in comparison to this, which we suffered at a small village, the name of which I do which we suffered at a small village, the name of which I do not remember. The house was dismal and dirty beyond all description ; the bedclothes filthy enough to turn the stomach of a muleteer; and the victuals cooked in such a manner, that even a Hottentot could not have beheld them without loathing. We had sheets of our own, which were spread upon a mattress ; and here I took my repose, wrapped in a great coat, if that could be called repose, which was inter¬ rupted by the innumerable stings of vermin. That Smollett, in recording the incidents of such a journey, should have put a good deal of gall into his ink, is not a matter of surprise ; but it is rather re¬ markable that his journal should be so devoid of lite- rary merit.

He faithfully records the steep hills which he had to climb, as if the ache the steep hills which he had to climb, as if the ache were not out of his bones when he wrote; but he says nothing of the glorious prospects which rewarded him when he had got to the top. His sketches of the character and manners of the péople remind one of the story told of a petty officer, on board an English man-of-war, who, when required to keep a journal of his voyage, and note the manners and customs of the places he visited, set down in his diary on one occa¬ sion, * The inhabitants of this country have no manners at all, and their customs are very beastly.? This just about the sum and substance of Smollett’s judg¬ ment of the Italians. Smollett’s journal is not wholly occupied with the record of his Italian tour, but the larger part is devoted to his travels in France and his residence at Nice.

I have travelled with economists in England, who declared they would rather give away a crown than allow themselves to be cheated of a farthing. This a good maxim, but requires a great share of resolution and self-denial to put in practice. In one excursion, my fellow-traveller was in a passion, and of consequence very bad company, from one end of the journey to the other. He was incessantly scolding either at landlords, landladies, waiters, ostlers, or postilions. We had bad horses and bad chaises; set out from every stage with the curses of the people ; and at this expense I saved about ten shillings in a journey of a hundred and fifty miles., For such a paltry consideration, he was contented to be mis¬ erable himself, and to make every other person unhappy with whom he had any concern. DR. MOORE. In 1775, Dr. Moore, the author of “ Zeluco,' passed some months in Italy, as medical attendant and travel¬ ling companion to the Duke of Hamilton, and published an account of the country upon his return home, with the title of ' A View of Society and Manners in Italy ; with Anecdotes relating to some Eminent Characters. The work was favorably received by the public, and indeed has a considerable degree of merit. The author, who had lived much upon the continent, was a man of candid and liberal spirit, and, though born a Scotchman and reared a Presbyterian, was free from national prejudice and religious intolerance. He had greatly the advantage of his countryman Smollett, not only in the enlightened judgment he passed upon                                 "

His po¬ sition as companion to the Duke of Hamilton gave him access to a higher class of society than he could have reached as a man of letters, or a physician ; and his tour is chiefly occupied with observations upon society and manners, as its title indicates. He had but little knowledge of art, as he more than once frankly con- fesses, and still less sensibility to nature ; but he is a shrewd and intelligent observer of men and manners, with an uncommonly quick perception of the ludi¬ crous, and a turn for satire, which, though always under the control of good sense and good nature, yet serves to give a spicy flavor to many a paragraph. The popularity of the work was mainly owing to its amusing sketches, to the many good stories which it contains, and to the lively and animated style in which the whole and to the lively and animated style in which the whole is written. He gives several pages to an account of the political constitution of Venice, and to some incidents from its history ; and I imagine he is the first popular English author who relates the stories of Marino Faliero and the Foscari.* He is also one of the first English travellers who describes a visit to Pompeii, of which then only a very small portion had been laid open. As the work of Dr. Moore is now not much known, I * Byron, writing to Murray from Venice, under date of Feb. 25, 1817, says, ’Look into “ Moore’s (Dr. Moore’s) View of Italy,\" for me ; in one of the volumes you will find an account of the Doge Valiere (it ought to be Falieri) and his conspiracy, or the motives of it.

This a quad¬ the church, stands the steeple of St. Mark. This a quad¬ rangular tower, about three hundred feet in height. I am told it is not uncommon in Italy for the church and steeple to be in this state of disunion ; this shocked a clergyman of my acquaintance very much ; he mentioned it to me, many years ago, amongst the errors and absurdities of the church of Rome. The gentleman was clearly of opinion, that church and steeple ought to be inseparable as man and wife, and that every church ought to consider its steeple as mortar of its mortar and stone of its stone.

An old captain of a ship, who was present, declared himself of the same way of think- ing, and swore that a church, divorced from its steeple, appeared to him as ridiculous as a ship without a mast.“ At Rome, he witnesses the Carnival, and says : The coachmen, who are placed in a more conspicuous point of view than others of the same rank in life, and who are perfectly known by the carriages they drive, generally affect some ridiculous disguise. Many of them choose à woman’s dress, and have their faces painted, and adorned with patches. However dull these fellows may be, when in breeches, they are, in petticoats, considered as the pleasantest men in the world, and excite much laughter in every street in which they appear. I observed to an Italian of my acquaint- ance, that, considering the staleness of the joke, I was sur¬ prised at the mirth it seemed to raise. “ When a whole city,\"’ answered he, “ are resolved to be merry for a week together, it is exceedingly convenient to have a few estab¬ lished jokes ready made ; the young laugh at the novelty, and the old from prescription.

The latter circumstance prevented our regretting the former, and although we had felt some uneasiness when we were told how little provisions there were in the house, the moment they appeared on the table we were all convinced there was more than enough. The poor people of this inn, however, shewed the utmost desire to please. They must have unfortunate tempers in¬ deed, who, observing this, could have shocked them by fret- fulness, or an air of dissatisfaction. Besides, if the entertain¬ ment had been still more homely, even those travellers who are accustomed to the greatest delicacies, might be induced to bear it with patience, for one night, from this consideration; that the people of the place, who have just as good a natural right to the luxuries of life as themselves, are obliged to bear it always.

He has recorded that for many years previous he could not look upon a book or picture which brought before him the image of Italy, nor even read a Roman author, without pain, so intense was the longing which they awakened. His earnest desire to visit Italy arose from his sense of its impor¬ tance to him in the light of self-culture, the great object to which his life was dedicated.

But his mind, at the time his journey was undertaken, was teeming with two works quite unlike any of his previous pro¬ ductions — the claims of which were to rest upon their tranquil beauty and perfection of form — ’Iphigenia in Aulis’ and Tasso;’ and in order to complete these, he felt it necessary to study the remains of ancient art preserved in the museums of Italy, and to gather the spirit fresh upon the soil of its growth. The account of his Italian journey, which was not published till more than twenty years after his return, being included in his general autobiography, is written in that exquisite prose, of which, if Goethe had never lived, we should have supposed the German language to be incapable. The attic bee hums over every page.

It is remarkable for being strongly personal, and, at the same time, cool, impassive, and emotionless. He looks at every thing with the calm stern eyes of the Olympian Jove, which do not soften even when they rest upon Semele or Europa. He avoids all sentimentality and enthusiasm; and seems determined to shew the world that the author of “ Werter’ can pass through the most exciting country in Europe, and yet never fall into ecstacies,                                  "

His residence in Rome gave him an opportunity of indulging that love of mystification, and those habits of reserve, which were marked traits in his character.

There is also a peculiarity in Goethe’s journal of his residence in Italy, which runs through his whole life; and that is, its self-reference. We see constant indi¬ cations of how important he was to himself. Self¬ culture — the growth of his own mind — these seem not only the highest, but the only aims which he proposes only the highest, but the only aims which he proposes to himself in life. Every thing which he sees comes before him in this relation, and is tried by this standard.

In the mood of mind in which he found himself, the present and the actual in which he found himself, the present and the actual were merely types and symbols. Nothing is de¬ scribed as it is, but every thing serves to suggest something else. He sees every thing through a veil of association and recollection. Goethe paints Rome, but Chateaubriand sets it to music. The latter does not contemplate it as an artist or a philosopher, but first as a Christian, and secondly as a classical scholar. Rome a Christian, and secondly as a classical scholar. Rome is most interesting to him as the head of the church; and the blood of martyrs which has bathed its soil is more to him than the dust of antiquity which covers it.

He sees the hand of God in the destruction of the monuments of paganism, and an the destruction of the monuments of paganism, and an ever-living faith springs up to assure him as the ivy and acanthus, which twine round the broken fragments, are pledges of the undying youth of Nature. He was especially impressed with the ruins of the Villa of Hadrian, of which he gives a long account, closing with these striking reflections : Before quitting the Villa Adriana, I filled my pockets with bits of porphyry, alabaster, verd antique, and pleces of stucco and mosaic, all which 1 afterwards threw away. These ruins are hereafter nothing to me, because it is not probable that any thing will ever carry me to them again. At every moment we die to a period, an object, a person, that we are never to see again. Life is a successive death. Many travellers, who have gone before me, have written their names on the marbles of the Villa Adriana. They have hoped to prolong their existence, by attaching a memorial of their fleeting presence to celebrated spots ; but they have been deceived. While I was attempting to decipher a name, newly written in pencil, which I thought I recognized, a bird started from a tuft of ivy, and a few drops of the recent shower were shaken from its leaves, and falling upon the name, blotted it out forever.'

It is entirely devoted to Rome and its environs; and the ruins which embellish and dignify the soil are dwelt upon with especial interest. He throws over that whole region the rapid, idealizing, and assimilating glance of genius. It is a series of exquisite pictures, painted by the light of a setting sun, and enclosed in frameworks of rich and melancholy reflection. He arrests and condenses the spirit that hangs over the landscape, enshrining it in his sparkling and perfumed periods, as an acre of roses reappears in a few drops of intense and penetrating essence. The whole letter is a grand symphony of eloquence and poetry, which recalls the noblest productions of Beethoven in a sister art. I proceed to translate a few passages from it, regretting that so much of the charm of the style must pass off in the course of transfusion into another language.

Often, upon the extended plain, I have believed that 1 saw rich harvests, but on approaching found that 1 had been deceived by the appearance of the withered herbage. Every where under these barren harvests the traces of ancient cultivation are distinguishable. Here are no birds, no laborers, none of the movements of rural life, no lowing of cattle, no villages. A few decaying farm-houses appear in the midst of the general desolation, but there issue from them heither smoke, nor sound, nor inhabitants. A kind of savage, almost naked, pale, and wasted by fever, keeps guard over these sad abodes, like the ghosts which, in our Gothic tales, forbid approach to deserted castles. You will think perhaps, my dear friend, after this descrip¬ tion, that nothing can be more repulsive than these Roman plains. It is far otherwise; they have an inconceivable grandeur. One is ever ready, in looking at them, to exclaim with Virgil, “ Salve, magna parens frugum, Saturnia tellus, Magna virum.\" If you view them with the eye of a political economist, you will be in despair ; if you contemplate them as an artist, a poet, or even a philosopher, you will not wish them to be other than they are. The aspect of a field of corn, or of a hillside covered with vines, will not awaken in you such emo¬ tions as the sight of this region, where modern cultivation has never renewed the vigor of the soil, which remains as old as the ruins which cover it. Nothing can equal the beauty of the lines of the Roman horizon, the gentle inclination of the plains, and the soft and blending outlines of the mountains which enclose them. The valleys in the Campagna often take the form of an arena, a circus, or a hippodrome ; the sides are cut in the shape of ter¬ races, as if the powersul hands of the old Romans had carried off the soil.

You have doubtless admired in the landscapes of Claude Lorraine that light which seems ideal and more beau¬ tiful than nature. Such is the light of Rome.

Sometimes lovely clouds, like fairy cars, borne along by the evening wind with inimitable grace, recall the mythological tales of the descent of the deities of Olympus. Sometimes old Rome seems to of the deities of Olympus. Sometimes old Rome seems to have spread all over the west the purple of her consuls and her Cæsars, beneath the last steps of the god of day.

He languished eleven years in captivity, in various parts of France, and died within a little more than a vear after his return home, his constitution having been worn out by the sufferings and anxieties he had passed through.

How beautiful and picturesque is his account of the illumination of the interior of St. Peter’s by the lighted cross at Easter: No architecture ever surpassed in effect the interior of this pile when illuminated at Easter by a single cross of lamps.

Nor had she paid much attention to art, in any of its forms or departments. Indeed, minds of such original power as hers, which have within themselves the inexhaustible fountains of genius to draw from, rarely submit to the patient study and prolonged examination which are indispensable to a thorough comprehension of the arts of sculpture and a thorough comprehension of the arts of sculpture and painting. Their time may be better spent in creation than in analysis and criticism; in the production of new forms of béauty rather than in the observation of those which other minds have given birth to. Men of genius are more apt to feel art than to understand it; and they sometimes mistake the emotions which a work of art calls forth, for essential characteristics of the of art calls forth, for essential characteristics of the work itself.

The great and lasting popularity of ’ Corinne’ ren- ders it superfluous to dwell at any length upon its characteristic excellences, or to quote from its inspired pages. Indeed, it would be doing the author injustice, to give to her eloquent conceptions the garb of any to give to her eloquent conceptions the garb of any other language than that in which she had clothed them. Her prose is absolutely untranslatable. To say nothing of her many felicities of phrase which dissolve as soon as they are touched, there is a certain declamatory recitative in the movement of her periods, which suits the genius of the French tongue, but sounds strained and affected in English. The plan of the work, combining a romantic love¬ story with pictures of Italian life, manners, and scenery, was a most happy thought, and gave full scope to all the writer’s powers. The birth, growth, and tragical close of a mutual attachment between two highly en- dowed beings, upon the soil of Italy, where every passion felt by susceptible natures becomes at once more intense and more exalted, was a theme pecu¬ more intense and more exalted, was a theme pecu¬ liarly suited to Madame de Stael’s genius, so imagina- tive and at the same time so craving the support of love and sympathy. In the execution, also, there is so much of grace, power, and feeling, that all de¬ fects of detail are overlooked.

Camillus preferred a cottage, amid the ruins of Rome, still smoking after the Gallic con¬ flagration, to the palaces of Veii ; and the natives of this town prefer their country, though on the verge of a fiery abyss, to a secure but foreign mansion. We applaud the patriotism of the former; why should we not praise the spirit of the latter ? In this characteristic paragraph we have not only a specimen of Eustace’s own prejudices, but an illustra¬ tion of the follies and inconsistencies into which all men fall when they give themselves over to the guidance of prejudice. The French traveller whom he cites is the President Dupaty, who makes the comparison about the ants, on occasion of a visit to Pompeii.

We should think it unreasonable in an Italian traveller in England who should complain that the sun was not in England who should complain that the sun was not bright, and that there were no oranges growing in the open air. Her explosions of Anglican and Protestant feeling provoke from M. Ampère, a Frenchman, a Catholic, and a lover of art, some caustic criticisms: That the English, in entering Italy, and especially at the commencement of a residence in Rome, should be strongly im¬ pressed with the want of comfort and neatness in the people that the obvious defects of Italian governments in general, and of the Papal government in particular, should offend men accustomed to the spectacle of constitutional manners — and that they should express their dissatisfaction with the people and the government in energetic terms — is certainly very natural. Since the days of the whig Addison, who, as we have seen, displayed with much pride in the presence of Rome the feeling of the political superiority of England, almost all Englishmen who have followed him have repeated the same lofty commonplace. They have a fair right to have this satisfaction of Italy for the blessings which she enjoys and are denied to them — such as sun, sky, climate, percep¬ tion of art — but they should not surrender themselves to a too contemptuous pity. From the height of their immortal constitution, which is beginning to totter, and of their sub¬ lime philanthropy, which has never found bread for Ireland, they should not too arrogantly hurl disdain or compassion upon a noble city and an admirable people, who would not change their ruins and their churches for the manufactures of England, their sunshine for hydrogen gas, the genius which reared the Colosseum and St. Peter’s, carved the Laocoon or painted the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, for the industrial energy which has constructed the steam-engine or carried the useful arts to such perfection, as to have spun during the last                                    "

Ampère in another form to say, that Lady Morgan is wanting in that imagination and poetical feeling which give such charm to the writings of Madame de Stael and Chateau- briand upon Italy. Her sketches are all in the colors of prose : fhe present and the practical hold sway over her mind. She never wholly surrenders herself to any fine or imaginative influence, and however pow¬ erfully the heart or the fancy may be addressed, she never fails to let fall some caustic comment or dispar¬ aging fling, to prove her cold self-possession. The display of the illuminated cross in St. Peter’s during Easter week, for instance, is described by all travellers as a most impressive spectacle, acting upon the imagi¬ nation through the senses to an extent almost unparal¬ leled, warming the most prosaic bosoms into a glow of unwonted admiration, and filling the minds of such of unwonted admiration, and filling the minds of such as are endowed with poetical sensibility with visions of celestial glory. But what is the mood in which Lady Morgan looks upon this sight, and what are the im¬ pressions which it leaves upon her memory ? A brief extract from her description shall answer: The pious votarists on the right, on the contrary, were all true “ mortal mixtures of earth’s mould ;’’ and chuckle¬ headed princes, and ponderous princesses, squatted on their carpets, like Indian pagods, and thumped and bumped, and crossed and groaned in vain ; none were edified by their de¬ votional exercises ; not even the mailed soldiery who guarded them.

Supposing all this irreverence to have been strictly true, which may be fairly doubted, what use is there in noticing, still less in remembering and recording it? Every thing in life has its reverse side. All our earth¬ ly glories and pageants are attended with homely elements, or unlucky mischances, which a morbid imagination may magnify so as to turn the whole into burlesque. The slave in the Roman triumph embodied this mocking spirit of parody, but who would volun- tarily assume the character? The nobler the nature, the more will it overlook what was not meant to be seen, and forget what was not meant to be remem¬ bered.

There is a masculine vigor in the grasp of her understanding, and a mascu¬ line energy in her style.

The spring of 1819 was passed in Rome. Here he lost a son ; and he and his wife left the spot too pain¬ fully associated with his image, and resided during the summer in a small house near Leghorn.

His feeling for art was fine and true, but his knowledge of it was superficial ; nor does he appear to have given much time to the examination of the galleries of Rome or. Florence. His love of art and his love of books were less strong than his love of nature. The former were but tastes, the last was a passion. He spent much time in the open air, and his bodily and mental health were improved by it. The climate of Italy was in unison with his delicate organization, and even the fierce heats of its summers, from which every other living thing shrank, gave him strength and spirits. Thus, in the various works produced by him while residing in Italy, there is no trace of any influence ex¬ erted upon his mind by Italian literature or society, but constant indications of the power with which nature acted upon him. The luxuriant vegetation of Italy, its light and richly colored atmosphere, its sparkling its light and richly colored atmosphere, its sparkling seas, and the azure depth of its clear sky seem to have inspired the lavish and gorgeous descriptions of Prometheus Unbound,’ Epipscychidion,' * Adonais,' Prometheus Unbound,’  Epipscychidion,' * Adonais,' and “The Sensitive Plant.’ In pure description : such as is not warmed by passion or deepened by philosophical reflection — he is a great master.

Were the tragedy now first dis¬ covered in manuscript, and did we only know that it was written by some one- who was alive in 1819, was written by some one- who was alive in 1819, Shelley is one of the last persons to whom, from the internal evidence of his other poems, it would be as¬ signed. In connection with his early death, we read it with a melancholy interest as an earnest of what he might have done had he lived longer, and, instead of weaving airy webs of abstraction, and steeping them in the gorgeous hues of fancy, had sought his themes in the course of real life and the emotions of the com¬ mon heart. Admirable, however, as * The Cenci’ is, it takes nothing from Italy but its subject. It is a very original work, drawn from the depths of his own heart and the treasures of his own mind. It might as well have been written in London as in Leghorn. There is nothing in it which tastes of the soil. The influence of Italian models is not felt, though it is a faithful picture of Italian society at the time when the scene is laid.

The latter are fierce, abrupt, sarcastic, and personal ; but Shelley’s are gentle, affectionate, and refined, shewing great domestic tenderness and a pas- sionate love of nature.

            "﻿428 LORD BYRON. Lord Byron resided in Italy from the autumn of 1816 to the summer of 1823, when he went to Greece. He to the summer of 1823, when he went to Greece. He lived first in Venice, then in Ravenna, subsequently in Pisa, and lastly in Genoa. It would be difficult to find a writer whose works contain so much to admire, and a writer whose works contain so much to admire, and whose life presents so little to respect ; and within the period of his residence in Italy are comprised the most splendid creations of his genius and the lowest degrada¬ tion of his character. In reading his letters and jour¬ nal, we are disgusted with the passionless profligacy of his habits, from which an escape into open adultery was impassioned. In Shelley's mind one visible object suggests another, but Byron personifies the whole scene, and interprets it by epithets drawn from human passions and emotions. He speaks of the 'agony,' the ' delirious bound,' and the *fierce footsteps ' of the waters; of the ' delirious bound,' and the *fierce footsteps ' of the waters; of the' distracted waters, ’and the ’ torture of the scene.' There is a glit¬ tering animation and dazzling richness in Byron’s verses which will not allow the mind to fix a searching glance upon them, but they will not bear a dissecting criticism. They are vague and indistinet, and will answer for one waterfall about as well as another. Nor will all the images and embellishments be commended by a stern taste. The comparison of the foam dripping from the rocks to the 'sweat of their agony’ is doubtful, to say the least. The rainbow hovering over the stream is likened first to 'Hope upon a death-bed,' and over the stream is likened first to 'Hope upon a death-bed,' and then to “ Love watching madness' — both a little fantastic and far¬ fetched. Shelley's simple prose challenges no comparison with Byron’s elaborate verses, but his outline is more correct in drawing than his noble friend’s splendidly colored picture. Judging from my own impressions and recollections, I should say that both were over¬ stated. The Velino is a deep and rapid stream, but only about fifty feet wide. It certainly makes the most of itself, but when the poet talks about ’ the fountain of an infant sea,' and about its ’ com¬ ing like an eternity as if to sweep down all things in its track,' he ing like an eternity as if to sweep down all things in its track,' he must have remembered more than he saw.

He was very susceptible to influences from without, whether derived from books or conversation, and thus his Italian experiences had much to do in shaping the channels in which his genius flowed. He spoke the Italian language with fluency and correctness, and could doubtless have written in it if he had chosen so to do. He mingled to some extent, especially while in to do.

That the products of his mind should be moulded and colored by the books which he read, and the social atmosphere the books which he read, and the social atmosphere which he breathed, was inevitable. His * Beppo is the most perfect reproduction in English of the gay the most perfect reproduction in English of the gay and laughing tone of Berni and Ariosto, with here and there a sting of sharper satire, and a burst of more pas¬ sionate feeling, than we find in the airy movements of Italian genius, which flutters lightly over the surface of things, without piercing to their depths. The manner is conversational, and the language the simple current coin of daily life ; but the right word always slips into the right place, and the strong English is moulded into as graceful forms as the soft Italian. The story is as graceful forms as the soft Italian. The story is nothing in itself — a slight anecdote which might take ten minutes in the telling — but we lose sight of this in the brilliant description, the playful banter, the collo¬ the brilliant description, the playful banter, the collo¬ quial grace, and sparkling animation which accompany it. In the vivid stanzas upon Italy — too well known to be quoted — which glow with all Giorgione’s depth of coloring, he rises for a moment into a higher mood, and lets the laughing mask drop from an impassioned brow; and in his brief and caustic sketch öf London literary society, there is a momentary intrusion of per¬ sonal feeling venting itself in a vehemence of sarcasm not in unison with the rest of the poem.

The sconery of the Alban and Sabine hills, and the peculiar aspect of the Campagna, are fruitful in themes on which the descriptive genius of the noble poet would assuredly have paused and lingered, had his residence in Rome been prolonged. What he might have gath¬ ered in these fields for our admiration, may be inferred from the exquisite image which the view-of Mount Soracte suggests to him- from out the plain Heaves like a long-swept wave about to break, And on the curl hangs pausing’- Nothing can surpass the beauty and accuracy of this comparison.

Nor does he appear to have taken any pains to explore the grand beautiful scenery of Italy, and to refresh his worn faculties by that communion with nature of which he writes in such glowing terms. In¬ deed, it may be well doubted whether Byron had, in his heart of héarts, a genuine love of nature, and whether the predominant impulse which drew him to a noble landscape, were not its capacity of being repro¬ duced in verse. His movements and residences, while in Italy, seem to have been mainly regulated by his in Italy, seem to have been mainly regulated by his relations to women,“ which, with the pursuit of literary fame, occupied his whole time and thoughts, till the trumpet-call of the Greek revolution roused him to a transient gleam of self-sacrificing action.T * In a letter to Moore, dated Rome, May 9, 1817, he says, (Ihave not been here long enough to affect it as a residence, and I must go back to Lombardy, because I am wretched at being away from Marianna.'

But none but the very voung need be told that there is no necessary connection be- tween imagination and sensibility, and that emotions may be admirably painted which are not habitually felt. That Words- worth and Cowper were lovers of nature — that Goethe was a loyer of art — are proved by their lives as well as their writings. But I submit that the facts of Byron’s life shew no more than this, that he felt a beautiful scene or a beautiful statue when brought before them, but that he never took any pains, or went out of his way, to procure either class of satisfactions.

Such is the wisdom of renunciation ! such is the folly of eating seed-corn instead of sowing it! After the of eating seed-corn instead of sowing it! After the passionate melancholy and intense ideality of ' Childe Harold,' the tone of Italy’ will seem, especially to Harold,' the tone of  Italy’ will seem, especially to the young, languid, and its côlors faint; but the latter poem wears well to the end. Men who have lived through the Byron age, in their own lives, are a little shy of the poetry which is so strongly associated with past conflicts and spent storms; but the mellow wisdom, the genial sympathy, the graceful pictures, and the perfect taste of Rogers are not fully appre- ciated till our shadows have begun to lengthen. It is, indeed, a delightful poem; a work of such perfect art that the art is nowhere seen; with just the right art that the art is nowhere seen; with just the right amount of personal feeling; with a warm sense of all that is attractive to a poet and a scholar in Italy, and a nature, which seems to me of much weight. His usual habit was to rise between one and two in the afternoon, and to sit up during the greater part of the night. No true lover of nature ever falls into ways of life like these, or consents to lose the beauty and freshness of the morning hours. Byron felt female beauty as few men have ever done; and his descriptions of female beauty have a sincerity, a vitality, and a heartiness, which I do not find in his descriptions of nature, brilliant as these are.

Her judgments in art are fearlessly uttered, sometimes striking, but not, always sound. Her severe strictures upon the character of the people betray the exaggeration both of temperament and of sex. Her energy is not always under the control of perfect taste, and sometimes degenerates into what were she not a woman — we should call coarseness. This occasional blemish doubtless springs from the dis¬ position of vehement natures like hers, to seek right in a point the most remote from wrong : her protest against the silly prudery so common among American women, taking the form of extreme plainness of speech and a hardy grappling with subjects which feminine pens usually avoid, or at least touch upon very lightly. The great merit of the work consists in the admirable descriptions of scenery and nature which it contains. Her sense of beauty — of the beauty of color, espe¬                                "

A single expression, or even word, dashed with an ap- parently careless hand upon the canvas, produces a fine effect. She speaks of “ a sulky-looking mountain, of the unhesitating white of Italian daisies ; and, again, of ' wide-eyed daisies,' of ’ a rusty donkey’ — a very of ' wide-eyed daisies,' of ’ a rusty donkey’ — a very happy, though very obvious epithet — and of ' snow¬ white drifts of hawthorn.' Her illustrations have sometimes the quaintness of Cowley ; as when she compares the arches of an aqueduct to ’ the vertebræe of some great serpent, whose marrow was the living water of which Rome drank for centuries;’ or the sky, seen through a window of the ruined Villa Mondragone, to “a sparkling blue eye through the sockets of a skeleton.' Her account of a summer and autumn passed at Frascati, is written with great animation and genuine poetical feeling — especially her sketches of the wild solitudes and woodland regions of the Alban Mount. In the shadow of those grand old oaks and chestnuts, her impatient spirit, tried alike by its own vehemence and by unhappy circumstances, found that peace which she so often missed in the struggles and relations of social life. Mountain and forest scenery she paints with accuracy as well as enthusiasm : she both sees and feels. But, above all, her book is remarkable for the vivid truth of her descriptions of the Campagna; the vivid truth of her descriptions of the Campagna; that is, of the Campagna as an object of sight. She does not moralize or sentimentalize over it like Cha- teaubriand ; but no traveller has ever felt so deeply or reproduced so glowingly the impressions which the                                  "

Its outlines, its colors, its ruins, its living forms, its flowers — all reappear in her sparkling pages ; idealized, and yet faithfully represented. It will not be easy to find a more brilliant piece of descrip¬ tion than is contained in the few pages headed * Rides through the Campagna.’ Who that has been over the same ground will not recognize the truth as well as the beauty of pictures like these? Small valleys open into each other between these swel- lings, all golden with buttercups, or powdered, as with the new-fallen snow, with daisies ; gradually these gentle emi¬ nences rise into higher mounds with rocky, precipitous sides and cliffs, and rugged walls of warm yellow-colored earth and cliffs, and rugged walls of warm yellow-colored earth or rock, with black mouths opening into them, half-curtained with long tangled tresses of wild briar and ivy, and crested with gold fringes of broom and gorse, and blue-black tufts of feathery verdure. At a distance, where the plain opens again before us, clumps of wood, of insignificant appearance, dot the level ground ; on nearer approach, they lose the dwarf, stunted look which the wide field on which they stand tends to give them, and presently we ride slowly between the talon-like roots, and under the twisted, gnarled boughs the talon-like roots, and under the twisted, gnarled boughs of cork and ilex trees, warped into fantastic growth by the sweeping of the winds, and covering with their dusky foliage a wild carpet of underbrush, all strewed with flowers — vio- a wild carpet of underbrush, all strewed with flowers — vio- lets, purple hyacinths, with their honey-sweet smell and dark-blue blossoms, white spires of delicate heath, the clear azure stars of the periwinkle and the tall flower-fretted stalks of the silver-rod — asphodel ; these, woven into one cloak of beauty, spread themselves over the ragged sides and rough gullies of these patches of forest, and every now and then we reach an eminence from which a fine dark sea of hoary wood- land rolls down into the neighboring hollows, and crests the rounded promontories all around us.

Spalding’s ’Italy and the Italian Islands’ forms a part of the Edinburgh Cabinet Library. It is a truly admirable work, and from its being supposed to be merely a compilation, has not secured to its learned and accomplished author the literary reputation to which he is fairly entitled. It is a compilation, it is true ; but executed in a manner which gives it a right to wear the honors of an original work. Its range is very wide, embracing ancient and modern Italian his- tory; Roman and Italian literature ; the progress of art ; and the present social and material condition of the peninsula. All this done in a thorough and scholarlike manner; the results of a very extensive course of reading are presented in a systematic form and in a clear and easy style ; and the author’s judg- and in a clear and easy style ; and the author’s judg- ments, both of books and men, are sound, generous and discriminating.

It would be hardly fair to conclude a sketch, how- ever imperfect, of writers upon Italy and travellers in Italy, without a word of commendation and gratitude to the two guide-books of Murray, the * Hand-book for the two guide-books of Murray, the * Hand-book for Northern Italy’ and the * Hand-book for Central Italy and Rome.'

Their merits are of the highest order, and it is a privilege to have visited Italy under such excellent is a privilege to have visited Italy under such excellent guidance. Like all books which are constantly in the hand, they are exposed to the most minute and search¬ ing criticism; but they bear it well. I very rarely found occasion to correct a statement, or dissent from an opinion. They are compiled with so much taste, learning, and judgment, and have so many well-chosen quotations in prose and verse, that they are not merely useful guides but entertaing companions. I have useful guides but entertaining companions. I have constantly had recourse to them in the preparation of these volumes, to revive my fading recollections, and to procure names, dates, and statistics ; and I cheer¬ fully make an acknowledgment commensurate with my * obligations. * Murray’s Guide-books now cover nearly the whole of the continent, and he is one of the great powers of Europe. Since Napoleon, no man’s empire has been so wide. From St. Petersburg to Seville, from Ostend to Constantinople, there is not an innkeeper who does not turn pale at the name of Murray. not an innkeeper who does not turn pale at the name of Murray. An instance of this came to my knowledge. In the Hand- book for Switzerland, the Hotel Faucon at Berne had been called 'one of the best inns in Switzerland,' but in 1847 a new edition appeared with the words of praise omitted and the ominous sentence ' fallen off’ substituted.

            "CHAPTER XVIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS. ALL persons who travel at all visit Italy. No other country combines so many attractions, or speaks with so many different voices of invitation. Not to be drawn to Italy, not to be grateful for having seen it, not to remember it with vivid interest — is to be indif¬ ferent to every thing that took place before we our¬ selves were born. No other countfy has been so fruitful in great men: no one has left so large a legacy to the mind of to-day : no one has passed through such to the mind of to-day : no one has passed through such historical changes : no one presents such variety of interests. Ancient and mediæval Italy, together, com¬ bine all that is most marked and characteristic in the national life and intellectual development of England of Greece. The paths of the statesman, the and of Greece. The paths of the statesman, the scholar, the Christian pilgrim, and the artist, all meet upon her soil as a focal point of attraction. Italy is a country in which the traveller encounters much annoyance and discomfort : his patience is often tried, and his moral sense is sometimes shocked ; but when we look upon her shore for the last time, none of these things rise up in judgment against her.

The rainy days, the grasping innkeepers, the mendacious vetterini, the dinners that could not be eaten, the beds that murdered sleep¬ all these, as we look back upon them, only serve as shadows in a picture to bring out the lights in stronger contrast. We part in kindness: on the dial of memo¬ ry only the hours of sunshine are noted. There is a peculiar charm about Italy which corres- ponds to the primitive meaning of that perverted word, sentimental — a charm made up of beauty and misfor¬ tune. In literature, characters like the Master of Ra- venswood, and Mowbray in ’ St. Ronan’s Well’— the representatives of decayed families — if tolerably well drawn, are sure to awaken interest. The same feel¬ ing extends to declining nations. In prosperous and ing extends to declining nations. In prosperous and progressive countries we find elements which quicken the faculties of observation and judgment, commend themselves to the moral sense, and gratify the benevo¬ lent affections ; but Italy is more fruitful in influences which kindle the imagination and touch the sensibili¬ ties. The smiling fertility of Belgium is not so inter¬ esting as the dreary desolation of the Campagna. The twilight shadows of Rome are more touching and pensive than the morning beams of our land of prom¬ ise. It is but a variation of the same thought to say, that the sky, the scenery, the climate, the coast of Italy, leave impressions of feminine softness and femi¬ nine beauty. We remember England or Germany as we remember a valued and esteemed friend ; but the image of Italy dwells in our hearts like that of a woman whom we have loved.                                   "

            "CONCLUDING REMARKS. 451 The interest awakened by Italy is felt with peculiar force by our countrymen, because Italy is so rich in those elements which are most powerful in drawing a cultivated American to Europe, and because it offers such strong contrasts to what is most familiar to us, The mind of man craves to look after as well as be¬ fore : it needs for its full development a past as well as a future. Our own country supplies but one of these wants : the imagination craves a more dim out¬ line than the fresh youth of our land can supply : we mingle our sympathies with the distant experiences of other lands. Thus, in proportion to the extent of our reading is our eagerness to exchange thought for sight, and the cold page for the living forms. No Eng¬ lishman can comprehend the feeling with which a well-informed American looks for the first time upon Westminster Abbey. It is like the mountaineer’s first sight of the sea, or the seaman’s first sight of the mountains. It is to us not merely a venerable struc¬ ture but a new revelation : it wakes to life, and clothes with flesh, the dry bones of history. At school and at college, the great vision of Rome broods over the mind with a power which is never suspended or dis- puted: her great men, her beautiful legends, her his¬ tory, the height to which she rose, and the depth to which she fell — these make up one half of a student's ideal world. When we go to Italy, we seem to be seeing a drama acted which, before, we had only read. The Tiber, which so long flowed through our dreams, now flows at our feet : the Capitol, the Forum, the Alban Mount, stand before us in the light of day ; and the imagination easily supplies the forms which are the imagination easily supplies the forms which are                                  "

There is so little of movement and progress in Italy that I cannot conceive that an American — unless he that I cannot conceive that an American — unless he be an artist — should wish to live there. As we have no past, so Italy seems to have no future. There, no past, so Italy seems to have no future. There, humanity, weary with its long journey, and faint with its protracted struggles, has sunk into a state which is half slumber and half despair. She is the Hagar, as half slumber and half despair. She is the Hagar, as well as the Niobe of nations ; and to human apprehen-¬ sion nothing but an angel’s voice can revive her droop¬ ing spirit— nothing but an angel’s hand can point out ing spirit— nothing but an angel’s hand can point out to her the fountains of hope and strength. The change from America to Italy — from movement to repose, from the present to the past, from hope to memory: from the present to the past, from hope to memory: is soothing and delightful for a time ; but who would wish to transplant his life into that old soil? who would wish to share in decline and become a part of decay ? who would wish to live in the midst of social evils which he cannot remedy, and of abuses which he can- which he cannot remedy, and of abuses which he can- not help — to have his heart perpetually wrung with misery which he cannot relieve, and his indignation aroused by wrongs which he cannot right? Life is but another name for action; and he who is without opportunity exists but does not live. The American does not see Italy aright who does not find there fresh cause of gratitude for having been born where he was, and who does not bring home from it a new sense of the worth of labor and the dignity of it a new sense of the worth of labor and the dignity of duty. To have lived in that fair land — to have been for a time exposed to its fine influences — throws upon all the future hours a grace before unknown. The old                                  "

            "CONCLUDING REMARKS. 453 books put on new attractions, and the burden of accus¬ tomed toil is lightened. A residence in that country enlarges that shadowy realm of imagination and memo- ry, into which we can always escape when chased by troubles. In moments of weariness and despondency when the weight of life is pressing hard upon us the pictures which we have brought from Italy will rise up before us with restoring power: those lovely forms will breathe their own peace over the troubled spirit : the beauty which is there stamped upon the earth, the beauty which is there stamped upon the earth, and expressed in marble and upon the canvas, will and expressed in marble and upon the canvas, will glide into the mind, and help the thoughts to rise above dwarfing cares and debasing pleasures. The proverb that he who would bring back the wealth of the Indies must first carry out the wealth of the Indies, applies with more force to Italy than to any other country on the globe ; for Italy has had two dis¬ tinct lives, one ending with the downfall of the Roman empire, and one beginning with the new organizations which were patched up out of the ruins of that colossal fabric. Nor is this remarkable fact all ; but, as I have before observed, the two lives are unlike. In Italy, the child was not the father of the man: Roman and Italian are by no means equivalent terms. No human life would be long enough, no human powers would be vigorous enough, to provide a perfect preparation for Italy ; for that would include a knowledge of Roman history, Roman literature, and Roman law ; of Italian history and Italian literature; of the history of the Christian Church and of art in all its forms. The best faculties and the amplest opportunities must here select and discriminate. But, on the other hand, there is the and discriminate.

Every hour spent in previous preparation for an Italian tour brings its recompense of reward. Let an Italian tour brings its recompense of reward. Let no one, therefore, who is meditating such a journey be discouraged by the amount of what he cannot do ; but rather take encouragement from the thought of how much can be done. In the evenings of a single winter, judiciously and vigorously occupied, the seeds of many a precious harvest can be sown. The more learning a precious harvest can be sown. The more learning the better ; but a little is not dangerous. An ignorant man in Italy is a blind man in a picture gallery. man in Italy is a blind man in a picture gallery. In conclusion, I offer a word of advice as to the time for visiting Italy. Most travellers see it only in winter; but this a mistake. At this season, the weather is often cold and more frequently rainy ; the sky is cov¬ ered with a funereal pall of gray clouds ; the houses in the towns are damp and the streets are muddy ; in the country, the trees are leafless and the vines are the country, the trees are leafless and the vines are mere uncouth coils of cordage.; and every where, the faces of the people wear a mixed expression of patient resignation and impatient expectation. It is only in sunshine that the real life of Italy comes out ; and in its absence, works of art — churches, pictures, and statues — lose half their attractions. The heats of summer are said to be oppressive : on this point, I cannot speak from experience ; but the degree of heat is not greater than we sometimes have it; and the nar¬ row streets of the towns and the thick walls, spacious rooms, and stone floors of the houses, afford a protec¬ tion against it such as is unknown with us.

Of spring and autumn in Italy, I can speak from a brief experience ; and it is certainly not too much to say, that a week in September or April is fairly worth à month in winter. The bulb hardly differs more from the tulip than does Italy in winter from Italy in spring. This latter season in that country is the spring which the poets paint, and its beauties and delights are such that they need borrow no embellishments from the imagination. Language cannot translate all that is seen and felt in the sky, the earth, and the air.
