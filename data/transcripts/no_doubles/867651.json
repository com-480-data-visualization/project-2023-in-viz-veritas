            " PREFACE. HE Account, in some of the  following pages, of the great discoveries made among the ruins of Herculaneum, which  is much more extensive, par¬ ticular, and exact, than any that has before appeared; gave the first occasion to the thought of making any of these LETTERS public. In consequence of which, it was in¬ tended to publish only those which describe its present situation and circumstances, and the Antiquities found therein; together with the previous description of Mount Vesuvius, and relation of all the Eruptions which have happened, particularly that by which this City was overwhelmed. But the favourable opi¬ nion of Those, to whom some of the other LETTERS had been occasionally communi¬ cated, encouraged the Editor to compile a small Volume, rather than a Pamphlet. In doing which, he has endeavoured to dispose them in such a manner, as by the variety to render the whole a more agreeable entertain¬ ment. There VOL. I. "

His Sicilian Ma¬ jesty is building a Palace, and in it a fine Gal¬ lery, for the reception of all the Curiosities, which have already been, or may hereafter be, discovered, in this wonderful place; the number of which is dayly increasing. All these he designs to have ingraved, described, and explained, in the same manner, as in the Musaeum Florentinum. A Work of this nature can not be compleatly executed, till all these things have been ranged in their proper order in the intended Gallery; and consequently will not probably see the light, till some years hence. In the mean time, to prevent any anticipation, no one, who is admitted to the sight of these Antiquities, is permitted to make use of a pencil, either in the subterraneous City, or in the palace at in the subterraneous City, or in the palace at Portici.

To render which the less imperfect, all that could be found ad¬ vanced by others relating to this subject, has been collected, abridged, and subjoined by way of Notes; in which the various, and sometimes contradictory, relations of different persons may not be altogether unentertaning. In the first Edition, several paragraphs, having been omitted in different pages, were added altogether in a short Appendix at the end of the first Volume: these are inserted in this new Edition in the proper places in this new Edition in the proper places to which they belong. And an Appendix is now subjoined to each Volume, con¬ taining some alterations, and additions, particularly a translation of most of the Epitaphs, Inscriptions, &c. which are in Greek and Latin. When the translation of these was promised, it was not sufficient¬ ly apprehended; how difficult it would be to make good English of most, good sense of some, and any sense at all of others, by rea¬ son of their defects and apparent errors. On which accounts, it is feared, there may be more "

There is however one omission, of which it is proper to take particular notice, because it relates to a Piece, mentioned as part of the CONTENTS a Piece, mentioned as part of the CONTENTS of the Second Volume, 6 Observations upon 6 the sculpture of an antique Ivory Chair, * made in the seventh century; representing & our Blessed Saviouris flight into Egypt, and * his first miracle at Cana.

In all other respects, except the time of pub¬ lication, the Proposals have been strictly ob¬ served; and indeed much exceeded. So that the Editor flatters himself upon the whole, the Editor flatters himself upon the whole, that the Reader will think both the omis¬ sions and delay over-balanced, by the addi¬ tion of four sheets of Letter press, and tyo Copper-plates, more than were promised; without the least advance of the price on that account.

The palaces and hötels are very magnificent without, and embellished in the most elegant manner within. The nobility residing here seem to excell ours in the grandeur of their habitations, and in the encouragement they shew men of ingenuity and learning; to whom particular apartments are allowed in the Louvre. But the Parisians, I mean the commonalty, are like snails: they have substantial houses into which they can withdraw themselves; but have not wherewith¬ all to keep out poverty. As for their wives and daughters, I can see nothing in them of that engaging neatness, for which our British dames are so justly admired. To ask for news, is a very impertinent question; no occurrences, either foreign, or domestic, being suffered to be printed, except in the Gazette; and none, even in that, of the like trivial nature with wretched stuff, which is the daily amusement of your London politicians. So that, if one be curious to know what passes even here, one must make use of foreign papers, as of a re¬ flecting telescope, not to view the object direct¬ ly in the place where it is, but as it is brought nearer to the eye by a second mirrour.

Did you not retain some idea in your mind, I should want words to represent to you, as well as colours strong enough to paint, the true portrait of a Mademoiselle à la mode Paris. If you think, that a person of my business ought to reside there for some time, to improve in the art of colour¬ ing, you are much mistaken: for painters should studie nothing but what is natural, and avoid every thing that is hideous or hurtsul to the sight; to which the blazing cheeks of these Belles are very prejudicial: for my own sake therefore T turned my eyes, and my thoughts from them.

I Amongst the diversions at Fontainbleau, was at one that is ushered in with a great deal of magnificence, viz. a hunting- match, which the king very seldom misses a day. The ren¬ dezvous is at a fixed hour, in a large forest; where it is surprizing to see what a number of fine English hunting horses come bounding in. As soon as his majesty, &c. arrive, the stag is unharboured: the king, who is the best of is unharboured: the king, who is the best of horse- men, is always foremost in the chace. There is something very noble and delightful in the sight of two or three hundred horse-men streaming after him along the plain: no-body is permitted to ride before him; and, if it hap¬ pens to be a wet day, he takes delight in riding flow, and in having every body soaked about him. His dogs are almost as sacred as his own person: for great precaution is taken, that no one ride amongst them; and they are all marked with sign of the cross; an incite¬ ment, they imagine, to swiftness, as well as a defence from the head of a stag, or the tusk of a boar. The people, from the lowest to the a boar.

There are nineteen arches, each of which is about thirty five paces wide: the French out of vani¬ ty increase the number, telling strangers that there are thirty-eight; but they reckon the little ones which are turned in every pier, only to make the structure seem lighter.

As the captain was sailing into the port of Civita Vecchia, being about two miles off, he perceived tyo large boats, making out from the shore tovards him, filled with men.

In the fhort time the captain had to get ready, he had point¬ ed tyo four-pounders: but the swiftness of the row-boats prevented their doing any execution; and the Spaniards were on board of him imme¬ diately. He had no other resource but in his musquets, which he fired so effectually, that he cleared the deck of them in an instant; they soon repeated their rashness, and he as soon made soon repeated their rashness, and he as soon made them feel the effects of his resentment.

The Spaniards having eighteen men killed or drowned, made off to their privateer, with bitter menaces, &c.

And if other circumstances had been agreeable, the want of breeches, I assure you, would have been no great obstacle: for we have English la¬ dies here, who have scorned the danger of the seas, made their way over the Alpes, and climb¬ ed to the top of mount Vesuvius. Nor do Iat all wonder at it: for neither mountains, nor seas, nor sex, should have hindered me from visiting such an entertaining place; where architecture, painting, and music are in the utmost perfection.

At some leisure time, I intend to take down a description of the immense riches of a grand altar in the church of the Jesuits, and trans¬ mit to England, as a specimen of the rest. On S.

I saw there a fine picture in mi¬ niature by ROSALBA CARRIERA, a Venetian; who was a few years ago solemnly admitted and regi¬ sterid amongst the academicians, for her excel¬ lence in painting portraits. She is still living at Venice, and has drawn the picture of that most worthy young gentleman GEORGE PITT, Esq; which you will have an- opportunity of seeing, and There is a good portrait of the kingof Sardinia lately done in mezzo tinto by Mr BURFORD, from an original painting by CLEMENTINA at Turin, in the possession of his Excellency the Chevalier OSSORIO.

The ceremony of the admittance of one, which I saw at Naples, may not perhaps be altogether unentertaing; at least, not perhaps be altogether unentertaining; at least, I will take care, that it shall not be tedious. This I call the ceremony of sacrificing a victim at a nunnery: for I can’t help calling that poor at a nunnery: for I can’t help calling that poor creature such, whom either the determination of her friends, or her own poverty, compells to live her friends, or her own poverty, compells to live immured from the sight and converse of the world.

In honour of whom, there were solemn games called Τριόπια, Triopia; in which the prizes were tripods of brass, which the victors were obliged to conse¬ crate to him.

The eruption which happened tovards the lat¬ ter end of March in 1730, deserves particularly to be mentioned among the rest: not that it was one of the most fierce and noxious; but because it made a sensible alteration in the top of the mountain. For a great quantity of vitrified mat¬ ter, and of stones, being heaped up, rendered it much sharper and higher than it was before. The other remarkable particularities were; that the flames were more lively and bright than usual, and rose to an excessive height: the torrent, that was seen to run down the sides towards the sea, proceeded but a little way from the superiour mouth; but on the other part, where the sides of the volcano are almost surrounded and cover¬ ed by the northern rocks of the Monte di Somma, Vol. I.

By this short description, one may understand, that the lower bulk of this mountain forms, as it were, a pedestal, common to the two summits. The union of their base, and the division of their spires, cause them to be taken at a great distance, not for one single mountain, but for two; join¬ ed together to a certain degree of height, and from thence divided the one from the other. from thence divided the one from the other. Such is the constructure of Vesuvius in cur days: but itis not likely, that it had the same appear¬ ance in the most remote ages. To be convinced of this, one need only call to mind the visible transfigurations, which it has been known to un¬ dergo, in the last, and in the present age. That in ancient times Vesuvius consisted of one vast single pyramidal body, may justly be inferred from the testimony of ancient authors, who paint it in that state of unity. STRABO* says, that6“ Mount Vesuvius is surrounded on all sides with open fields extremely fruitful, except¬ ing onely the summit, &c. 33, DION † expresses himself in a more explicite manner. “ At first Vesuvius was of an equal height, on all sides; it then vomited out flames onely from the middle of its top: and therefore it is onely in that part, that its superficies has experienced the activity of fire; for * Lib.

Hence it comes to pass, that, having suffered no da¬ mage, the brims of the most elevated circuit re¬ tain their first height; while the centre of the same has sunk, at the will of those eruptions which have wasted it. Its sinking down forms a pit, or large cavity, disposed in such a manner, that the whole mountain, if one may compare little things with great, does not ill resemble the form of an amphitheatre. The torrents of liquified stones, which the mountain vomits up, when it exerts its fury, fur¬ nish a strong argument in confirmation of this opinion: for some of these are found in places, whither they could never possibly have come, had not Vesuvius formerly terminated in one single point. Of this there is a recent proof. A sew years ago, at the Dominican convent della Ma¬ donna dell’ Arco, in digging a well, at the depth of more than a hundred palms, the work-men discovered a torrent of that nature; having broken through it, they continued their work, till they were stopped by another, and afterwards by a third: in fhort, in less than the depth of three hundred palms, they found four beds of harden¬ ed matter, which exactly resembled the Lava, ed matter, which exactly resembled the Lava, which is seen every day at the southern foot of the mountain. –NOW, supposing the figure of VOL.

DION CASSIUS, in comparing Vesuvius to an amphitheatre, gives us an idea of it, which does not less agree with this opinion, than with the exact draught, which the same author has made of the whole mountain. According to him, the fire had not at allhurt the circumference, it was only the centre of the highest circuit, which had been ruined by the eruption of the flames. From hence it follows, that to DIONIS eyes, the middle, being made hollow, represented the arena of the amphitheatre; and the sides, the inner cir¬ cumference. Can there be one person found, who can imagine, that he sees in the present form, the image, which this historian has lestus? However, by taking advantage of the light which he offers, every one may perceive, that one part of the circuit of this amphitheatre is pre¬ served to this day. One discovers plainly this part m the northern hills, which form at present the m the northern hills, which form at present the Monte di Somma, and which inclose a good part of "

For one sees nothing there, but stones and rocks, all stamped, as it were, with the impression of the flames, all of the colour of burnt iron; as are other places, of the colour of burnt iron; as are other places, where we know that in cur memory the flames have exercised their force. Formerly, as wellas now, Vesuvius command¬ ed an open plain; no other mountain was joined to it: on which account, * some authors have su¬ spected, that it owed its first appearance, solely to the rage of subterraneous fires. Be that as it will, one cannot but judge, that the roots of the mountain took up less space in former times, than they do at present: they must needs have been they do at present: they must needs have been amplified by the continual eruption of ashes and stones; and above all bythe afflux of melted mat¬ ter, which in its congelation takes the hardness of a rock. –In the course of time, all thesce of a rock. –In the course of time, all thesce things must necessarily have swelled and dilated the foot of the mountain.

In pursuing this idea, we shall be convinced, that the sides of Vesuvius have a more gentle declivity now, than they formerly had: of which one may form a judgement, by inspecting the northern talus, which is the most steep, because it has undergone but little alteration, at least for it has undergone but little alteration, at least for these thousand years and more; that is, ever since the mountain was divided into tyo summits, which make the fork. – Thus the ancient height still remains marked out to us, by the point of the northern hills, which form precisely the Monte the northern hills, which form precisely the Monte di Somma: and this height, being once settled, places out of the reach of all objections what was said just now, viz. that the northern hills, the inward concavity of which appears all burnt, and hanging in a precipice, made a part of the circle, which struck DIONIS eyes, when he compared this mountain to an amphitheatre. Having thus formed a general notion of the ba¬ sis and height of the mountain, one may compre¬ hend, not onely the greatness of the whole mass, but likewise the extent of its summit. –Even in the age in which STRABO lived, the top appeared the age in which STRABO lived, the top appeared esplanaded, or like a glacis; some ancient con¬ flagration having, without doubt, taken off its point. But in DIONIS timè, according to his own testimony, the middle had sunk in, by reason of the "

By this means, and at that time, it took the resemblance of an amphitheatr; such it took the resemblance of an amphitheatr; such as one sees now in the Solfatara, and other neigh¬ bouring mountains, which may justly be illustrated by the same comparison.* From that period of time, at which we have just now marked the state and condition of this mountain, its aspect must have begun to change in a prodigious manner: the conflagrations, the earthquakes, the abysses made in its bosom, all inseparable accidents attending violent eruptions destroyed and ruined the part situated betwixt the south and the west; and their fury spared no¬ the south and the west; and their fury spared no¬ thing, except the hills which Iook towards the east and north. – This ruin, this falling in of the top, might well gain ground, even to the borders of that place, where we see the volcano separated from the hills, which partly surrounc it. And now, behold a new aspect of Vesuvius; of which one can bring no other proof, than a of which one can bring no other proof, than a plausible conjecture, because the contemporary authors have made no mention of it, or perhaps because their works are lost.– –In short, as ri¬ vers, when they are swelled and rapid, carrie a¬ way the ground from some of their banks, and add it to others: just so the violent burnings, which * See PELLEGRIN Disc. ii.

That this volcano is the work of violent con¬ flagrations, that it has been formed by the heap¬ ing up of ashes, rocks, and other materials, thrown out from above, one may judge by this single circumstance, that it keeps exactly the co¬ nic figure: the same, which a lump of earth re¬ tains, which has been cast up by a mole; the same, which a heap of sand or wheat, or any o¬ ther small and dry things would preserve, were they let fall continually and perpendicularly. The internal boiling at first swelled the ground; then the ashes, stones, and other materials, blown up the ashes, stones, and other materials, blown up into the air, fell down almost directly near the mouth, which had vomited them up; and thus the pyramid was raised. But PELLEGRIN is of a different opinion. He thinks, that the cinereous and burnt matter, of which the volcano is composed, is no other, either in "

We shall not dissemble at all in this matter; but shallown that in phenomenas, where Nature, to signalize her power, makes use of the most surprizinę means, such as are those of fire, one cannot ima¬ gine, nor propose any thing, without some ap¬ prehension of being mistaken; especially, when  one has no assistance from the light of history. Let us then content our- selves with having de¬ monstrated, that the ancient form of Vesuvius was very different from the present; and that it was at first but one single mountain, from the foot to the summit. Whence we may very safely con¬ clude, that its fork, so visible at this time, is no other than a later effect of its frequent and for¬ midable conflagrations. As the most proper conclusion to the preceding account of the ancient and present form of this mountain, I shall subjoin a short description given by the same gentlemen, of the state and condi¬ tion, "

There is no very faithful and very particular description of the state of Vesuvius before that time. Thol several accounts have been publish¬ ed, vet none of them have those authentic marks and characters, which ought to accompanie an indubitable relation. — There is one thing, of which not onely we, but all the Neapolitans can assure the public, that before the last eruption, the southern summit, from whence the fire pro¬ the southern summit, from whence the fire pro¬ ceeded, was much higher than it is at this day¬ It was not onely higher, but it vas likewise more sharply pointed; and so it appeared to those who viewed it from within the city. The internal part of this top has also changed its disposition: this we infer from the manner in which the smoke is almost continually exhaling; not united in one single cloud, as it was former¬ ly, because it then proceeded out of one single mouth. But now, as it proceeds out of five or six mouths, at some distance from one another, it forms five or six pillars: which appear very distinct before sun-rising, when the air is pure and calm: and if it sometimes get so together, as if it spouted out of the same vent, it is, when the it spouted out of the same vent, it is, when the evaporation becomes very copious, or else when the wind blows very briskly.

For the compleat number of the English college is but thirty, of which at present there are only twenty; that of the Scotch, no more than nine, of which even three are now wanting: and none but that of the Irish is full, who have always kept up their number, which is likewise but nine. So that out of these three colleges, which, if full, as they scarce ever are, have but 48 scholars, comes a constant supply of 2000 missionaries, who re¬ fide always amongus, to propagate the Catholic Faith.

In the library at the Vatican I saw the Aspestos, in which they used to wrap up the body that was to be burned, in order to preserve the bones and to be burned, in order to preserve the bones and ashes unmixed with the combustibles: it is woven like a net, and some say, composed of the filings of a particular sort of stone; thos others will of a particular sort of stone; thos others will have it to be a vegetable. Whatever it is, it re¬ sists the fire: and to trie it, we rubbed one part with some wax- candle, and set it on fire; and it continued burning ten minutes, without being in the least consumed; and then returned to its the least consumed; and then returned to its white, natural colour. A young lady here has been accused by her husband of incontinency, and of a design upon his lise: but the proof not being thought sufficient, she was ordered to undergo the torture, that a confession might be extorted from her; which, according to the strange lav here, is necessary to à full conviction. The manner of it was thus: she was dravn up almost naked, by her hands tied behind her, to the cieling of a room, and suspended there for an hour: which of necessity dissocated the joints, and put her to inexpressible pain: but all this she bore with the greatest pa¬ tience.

What a villam must the old fellow her husband be, if, in order to accomplisi some new amour, as ma¬ ny are apt to think, he could make such a sacri¬ fice of youth, beauty, and innocence? Or what a miserable, jealous- pated wretch, if he could be a miserable, jealous- pated wretch, if he could be instigated to such inhumanity, by his own ill¬ grounded suspicions? A useful lesson this to all, who may be inclined to imagine, that the chief blessing of the connubial state depends upon abun¬ dance of wealth; and that this alone is sufficient to render it tolerable, if not agreeable.

Some talk, as if there was a design to place a statue of Justice, or some other modern figure, upon this pedestal: but how ridiculous would a modern statue appear, upon a pedestal with antique In¬ scriptions and Basso Relievos!

It was with some difficulty, and by the interest of Mr. ALLEN, the English consul, that we were admitted to see them at all, the first time, about three years ago. Which dif¬ ficulty was occasioned by an attempt just before to make some designs of the paintings by CA¬ MILLO PADERNI; who was thereupon imme¬ diately sent packing. Ever since which time, those who are allowed the favour of seeing them, are watched very narrowly, and not permitted to make use of a pencil. All therefore that I could do, was to range them in my memory, as well as I could; and from thence to commit them to paper the same day. This I did twice; and have since compared my notes with the memo¬ ramdums and remarks of others, and thereby made considerable additions to them.

And what first mention may appear strange, those very things, which are the natural and original causes of desolation in particular parts, are likevise the chief causes of the general abun¬ dance of the inhabitants. For throughout this tract, besides great plenty of more noble mine¬ rals, there is a vast quantity of sulphur, bitumen, nitre, allum, vitriol, and other salts; which con¬ tribute to render both the soll fruitful; and the air healthsul. And these, by a close mixture with one another, or from some more hidden reason, are naturally disposed to be easily heated and even inflamed; and thereby produce the sources of those hot waters, which spring up in such a num¬ ber of places. And it is not very difficult to imagine, how these different kinds of inflamma¬ ble matter, diffused and concealed under ground, may by degrees be heaped together and augment ed in some one district; how afterwards byan in¬ ternal motion they may take fire; and howat last this fire, having forced the earth to crack, may throw itself abroad with the greatest rage and fury, and produce all the phenomena that accom¬ panie the eruptions of volcanos.

But when that part of the Book was printing off, the Editor was under great uncertainty, whether he should venture the Latin Verses abroad, or not. But having shewed them formerly to several persons, who seemed pleased with them as being written with some spirit; he was the more readily induced to acquiesce very lately in the judgment of an ingenious and learned Gentleman, and good Poet, who was of opinion. that they would be no improper addition at the end of the Volume, as they had a relation to the subjects of several of the preceding LETTERS When this was determined, a difficulty arose with re¬ spect to those Ladies and Gentlemen, who, thol having no want either of wit or sense, yet might not understand no want either of wit or sense, yet might not understand Latin: in regard to whom, the Editor chose rather to ha¬ zard his reputation, as a Translator, than to leave their curiosity "

The T twentieth degree is the highest, and implies sovereign perfection; which no man has fully arrived at. The nineteenth is the highest degree that we know; but which no person has yet gained. And the eighteenth is, for those who, in my opinion, have come nearest to per¬ fection; as the lower figures are for those who appear to be further from it. Thave past my judgment only on the most noted paint¬ ers, and in the ensuing Catalogue have divided the chief parts of the art into four columns; to wit, Compo¬ sition, Design, Colouring, and Expression. By Expression I mean not the character of any particular object, but the general thought of the understanding. And thus the general thought of the understanding. And thus against each painters name, we see his degree of merit in all the aforesaid four Divisions. We might introduce among the most noted painters, several Flemings, who have very falthfully shewn truth of nature, and been excellent colourists: but we thought it better to set them by themselves; because their taste was bad in other parts of the art. It now only remains to be observed, that as the essen¬ tial parts of painting consist of many other parts, which the same masters have not equally possessed; tis reaso¬ nable to set one against another, in order to make a fair judgment. Thus for instance, Composition arises from two parts; viz. Invention and Disposition. Now a paint¬ O VOL. I. ter "

Again, to dispose them, so as to produce a great effect. Again, in Design, there is a taste and correctness; and a picture in Design, there is a taste and correctness; and a picture may have one of them only, or else both may appear may have one of them only, or else both may appear Jointly, hut in different degrees of goodness; and by comparing one with another we may make a general judgment on the whole. For the rest: Tam not so fond of my own sentiments as to think they will not be severely criticized: but T must give notice, that in order to criticize judiciously, one must have a perfect knowledge of all the parts of a piece of painting, and of the reasons which make the whole good; for many judge of a picture only by the part they like, and make no account of thse other parts, which either they do not understand, or do not relish.
