THE following sheets are offered to the Public with that anxiety of mind, which must naturally arise from the peculiar situation of the indi¬ vidual, on whom the mournful task has devolved of arranging for the press the productions of one who is no more ; an anxiety which, on the present occasion, instead of being lessened, is, perhaps, rendered only more acute, from the known high talents of the author. the known high talents of the author. But, though the responsibility on this account be proportionably greater, yet, it may be hoped be proportionably greater, yet, it may be hoped that his distinguished abilities will give some weight to his observations, even on subjects soreign to that line of science on which his celebrity is sounded; and the unfinished state in which the manuscript was left at his decease, may perhaps be allowed to plead for that in¬ dulgence which might otherwise have been denied, or might not have been required. These notes were not originally intended for the press. From Mr Bell's scientisic habits, he                      "

He was induced to visit Italy, in the hope of re¬ covering some portion of lost health; and he left Paris, in a state of debility which excited interest even in strangers, who knew him only by reputation. He was aware of his own situa- tion; but a singular degree of spirit, and ardoui of character, prevented his ever betraying any consciousness of it. The medical friend who attended him in Rome during his last illness and to whose skill and tenderness the warmest and to whose skill and tenderness the warmest tribute of gratitude is due; as well as to the Roman physicians, was much struck with these peculiar features in his character. A few pencilled lines, written by himself, in a blank leaf, before leaving Paris, show that he a blank leaf, before leaving Paris, show that he was well acquainted with his danger.

The day was in consequence generally far spent, ere he could find leisure to engage in his favourite pursuits, and write those remarks, which he trusted that some more quiet moment. would yet permit him to complete and arrange. The author's journey forms the most con¬ nected portions of his Notes, as he daily com- mitted his observations to paper. Criticisms on the arts, slight historical memoranda arising from associations, and the recollections which his well-stored memory, presented on visiting the scenes of which he had read, compose the desultory subjects of the sketches, which are now presented in their original state. The author, during his residence abroad, had many oppor¬ tunities of observing the dissiculties encountered by young travellers in forming their taste and opinions. Guide-books and Custodi, generally adopting but one language, describe every ob- ject as exquisite; he hoped, therefore, that some few observations, founded on principle, and pointing out the subjects most worthy of nouce, might render his work not only usesul as à book of reference to the inexperienced,                            "

These considerations, combined with the object of giving specimens of the author's various studies, will, the editor hopes , offer a sussicient apology for this publi¬ cation; nor will the feeling reader be unwilling to remember the melancholy circumstances un¬ der which they were written, by one suffering from the approaches of a fatal disorder,—whose life has been devoted to severe studies,—and whose discoveries and useful labours, have for¬ med an epoch in his profession. These recollec- tions may so influence his mind, as to lead him to trace in these sketches, the promise of what they would have been, had the author survived to prepare them for the press. Circumstauces have painfully conspired to delay the publication of this work to the present period. The Manuscripts were in the first instance, committed to the care of one who was peculiarly fitted for the task; but occu¬ pations of a high and important nature, obliged him, after eighteen months, entirely to relinquish the attempt. A farther interruption arose from the long declining health of the editor in whose the long declining health of the editor in whose                            "

The nature of this work, perhaps, renders these delays ol small importance, as criticisms on the fine arts, and views of scenery, can be little affected by it ; and perhaps to the speculative reader, the local changes which have occurred, whether in cities, manners, or customs, may present additional proofs of the constant vicissitude of all worldly concerns. Note. — The following remarks by the Author, being part of the briginal preface, prepared by him, are inserted to shew the object he had in view The fine arts may be styled the science of sentiment: to attain excellence in these pursuits, knowledge and imagination are called into action in these pursuits, knowledge and imagination are called into action and surely whatsoever tends to promote reflection, form the judgment and correct the taste , must elevate the mind and be productive of and correct the taste , must elevate the mind and be productive of general utility.—Therefore observations , considered solely as prelimi¬ haries to more mature studies on the subject, may not be entirely without value although being only the first principles leading to the higher points, those of embodying sentiment, and rendering internal feelings, and passions visible by exterior forms, which is the primary and great and passions visible by exterior forms, which is the primary and great scope of the artist.

We regret that this episode is too long for insertion, we substitute for it one of his nights in Florence, which we venture 1o say is without any parallel, in any composition in prose of poetry. Mr Bell's observations on Rome are inspired by all the choicest association of classical antiquity.

            "OBSERVATIONS ON ITALY.  CHAPTER FIRST. APPROACH TO LYONS—LYONS—MOSAIC PAVEMENT. WE began our journey into Italy in the beginning of June 1817, and left Paris on our way to Fontainebleau. It was a beautiful morning. The air had been rendered péculiarly mellow and refreshing by a severe storm the preceding evening; and a bright sunshine cheered us on our way, shedding its pleasing influence on the mind, and dispelling that undefined dejection of spirit, which with such powerful influence affects us at the outset of a long journey. Even in the brilliant hour of youthful hope, and gay anticipation, such a moment is not unclouded by some mixture of pain; the mind insensibly revolves the days that are past and looks forward with a feeling of anxiety to those which are yet to come ; but the spirit soon finds relief in the pleasing images, and the new stores of knowledge presented in travelling. The road from Paris by Fontainebleau to Lyons has been so often described, that I shall state only the Vol. I.                       "

The first, comparatively speaking, is vast and bleak; but, even at a short distance beyond Paris towards the South, the country becomes more pleasing and attractive. Trees of a larger growth, fine spreading oak, tall larches, pleasant valleys, and silvery rivers vary the face of nature, and present a cheerful and luxuriant scene. APPROACH TO LYONS. We reached the town of Macon, which is seated on the right bank of the river Saone, and, like Chalons, the right bank of the river Saone, and, like Chalons, has its beauty confined to one view, early in the evening. The line of houses which forms the street; the quay, and the bridge, are handsome, as also the public walk which you traverse on leaving the town. Throughout France, in every little city, however inconsiderable, there is a shaded and well-sheltered public walk. This seems as indispensable as a caffé These two lounging places are never empty, though they do not now perhaps present altogether the aspect they were wont to have. Formerly the French gaily danced away care, and laughed at poverty; but now, having become individually politicians, they are much more thoughtful and grave. The banks of the Saone, as the river widens after leaving Macon, become rich and beautiful, displaying an extended region of wood                             "

On these hills grow the most precious wines of France while the country is beautiful, rich, and fertile in every kind of produce; and still as we proceeded, new and pleasing views presented them- selves. On the opposite bank we beheld towns, castles and convents rising in the distance; sometimes, seated on the summit of a gentle elevation, lay spread out on the summit of a gentle elevation, lay spread out the cheerful village, with its spires shining throughi the stately trees; sometimes, with picturesque effect, the white dwellings of the farmer shewed themselves the white dwellings of the farmer shewed themselves on the rising bank, overhanging the broad clear stream below. The country, where we were travelling, expanded wide in low and somewhat marshy ground, but enriched with fine green wood, always open, and presenting extensive stretches of champaign country. At length we approached Mont d’Or. The river running flat and still, opens wide as a lake, and seems to lie at the foot of this beautiful sloping hill. In this district I observed a peculiarity in the manner of building, from which its general appearance derives much beauty. Each gentleman’s seat, or farm-house, has a low running line of front, from some one point of which, in an irregular form, rises a higher building, bearing somewhat the aspect of a tower, and giving an antique cast to the dwelling; its lower parts are an antique cast to the dwelling; its lower parts are capt with that flat projecting roof, which every where strongly characterises the architecture of southern countries.

As you ascend Mont d'Or every step of your progress is marked by new and striking objects; and from its summit the prospect is most superb. To the west is seen all the wild and billy country of Auvergne; to the south, the great chain of mountains, blue and splendid; and to the north, the fine valley of the Saone, and the high grounds around Autun. This valley, in which the view of the river is lost in its beautiful bend round the foot of Mont d’Or, extends for fifty miles; but still you see nothing of Lyons, to which you are approaching. At length, after a period of enjoyment and delight in surveying the surrounding scenery, we turned towards the valley below, and proceeded to descend a precipitous hill. But yet no token of this great capital appears ; no smoke, no spires, no suburbs of clustering houses; but splendid-built villas of white of clustering houses; but splendid-built villas of white stone in the best style of architecture, with cultivated fields, orchards, and gardens, adorn and enrich the slopes and hills.

The ancient city of this name, founded forty two years before the Christian era, lay high on the face of the hills, as is attested in the present day by relics of every kind. In the year 58, it was in one night burnt to the ground ; but shortly afterwards rebuilt by a grant from tbe Emperor Nero.* On that side of the hill where the city stood, near the site of the Forum built by Trajan, are found masses of melted metal. marbles, and other remains, which attest the calamity so pathetically described by Seneca. * On the bronze tablets found here are inscribed portions of the harangue of Claudius before he became Emperor, imploring the Senate to grant to Lyons, his native city, the title of a Roman colony.

The mountains of the pass, which you have just left, stand high and dark in the outline, forming an imposing back-ground to the small, richly-cultivated valley, spread out below; while the bridge, far beneath, lies in one long flat line, crossing the river, which is now seen winding its way, in various bends, and gathering its tributary waters from the adjacent rocks.

We understood these abodes were inhabited only three months in the year, by persons who gather the scanty vintage, fruits, or grain, produced in this region. Towards the close of this picturesque, but gloomy road that follows the course of the Arco, (which might emphatically be styled the Valley of Stones,) we looked towards a narrow pass , or gorge, of the mountain, bounding a beautiful little plain, which lay just before us.

This plainly accounted for the singular grandeur and force of the river Arco, on whose dashing and roaring stream we had seen immense branches, and even whole trees, borne along with resistless impetuosity. At this inn we were advised to remain; for, besides the three bridges which had been undoubtedly carried off, the road was represented as so torn by the flood, as to resemble the channel of a river. Notwithstanding this intelligence, we endeavoured, to proceed, but were obliged to return. After the delay of one day, we left the inn, and continued tracing the banks of the Arco, until we reached the little city of Lans-le-Bourg, where the stream takes a different course.

On reaching the summit of Mont Cenis, we looked down on the plain, and on its broad flat lake, and little boat. The sun, shining over the mountain from behind, cast a deep shadow across its surface.

We rolled down a smooth gravelly road, passing through a narrow gorge, or gully, resembling a quarry, backed on the left by enormous mountains, towering high and per- pendicular, and terminating in many forms of fantastic grandeur; while at the angles of the road, we sometimes caught glimpses of dells far beneath, with their villages and churches, presenting, in perspective, the beautiful scenery we were soon to approach.

Early on a beautiful morning we left Suza, travelling through narrow roads, littlestony vineyards, and pigmy inclosures of wheat and rye; we began to traverse the banks of the Doria, turbid as its fellow, the Arco, which runs down the opposite and western side of the Alps. Its frequent breaches over the fields, its wide¬ spread stony channel, its yellow waters, and roaring din, give it all the character of an Alpine stream, which, though pure at its source, becomes muddy here, from the clay of the mountains. At the narrowest point of the valley, it flows by a little fortress; and we crossed it, on a bridge defended by the fort. Here the stream bursts out into a broad and pebbly strand; and the prospect begins to widen, gradually spreading out into the grand valley of Piedmont, or of the Po. On the very pinnacle of a high hill, rising in the narrowest point of the valley, stands the magnificent and antique monastery of St Michael. This superb and singular hill, with its monastery, constitutes a striking feature in the landscape, from the pass above Suza down to Florence.

From the gulley above Suza. you see the Doria bursting forth, and trace its resplendent waters, pursuing their course through the arches of the long and slender bridges which span its tide; while the evening sun flames over the mountains, shooting the evening sun flames over the mountains, shooting down through the narrow valley, and touching with vivid tints the great monastery of St Michael, which stands solitary and majestic on its lofty hill.

At length we reached the desired object; the approach to which was enlivened by the appearance of a number of well-dressed pedestrians, moving along, in small parties, or family groups; some sauntering, others sitting on benches under the shade of the trees; but no carriages or post-chaises, no young men on horseback, gave gaiety to the scene, or presented any of that bustle and business which usually mark the approach to a capital; on the contrary , a certain the approach to a capital; on the contrary , a certain quietness and soberness of aspect seemed to prevail.

He was one of those hardened villains, who had watched his victim to the turning of a street, and suddenly stabbed him with a stiletto. One feels little compassion for a wretch who, not content with robbing, strikes from behind and pillages the victim while weltering in his blood.

On a sudden, the crossings were filled with a prodigious mob, hurrying from every quarter—sounds of deep and solemn music were heard; and I beheld the flags and insignia of a processions, which I imagined to be purely religious; when, to my surprise and horror, I found myself exactly opposite to the distracted criminal, whom they were conducting to execution, in all the agonies of terror and despair. He was seated in a black car, preceded by arquebusiers on horseback, carrying their carabines pointed forward. These were followed by a band of priests, clothed in long black robes, sing, in deep and solemn tones, a slow mournful dirge; part of the service for the dead. A hot burning sun shone with a flood of light; and though it was mid-day, such was the silence, and such the power and effect of this the silence, and such the power and effect of this solemn chant, that its sound was re-echoed from every distant street. The brothers of the Misericordia, clothed in black, and masked, walked by the side of the car, and joined in the chant. On the steps of the car sat a man bearing a flag, on which death was represented in the usual forms, and on which was inscribed in Latin, (if I read it rightly,) « Death has touched me with his fingers; » or, « Death has laid his hands on me. » On each side ofthe car, the officiating priests were seated ; and in the centre sat the criminal himself.

But the terrors thus raised, were the superstitions of an ignorant and bewildered mind, bereft of animal courage, and impressed with some consused belief, that eternal safety was to be instantly secured by external marks of homage to the image. There was here none of the composed, conscious, awful penitence of a Christian; and it was evident, that the priest was anxious only to produce a being in the near prospect of death, whose condition should alarm all that looked on him. The attempt was successful. But I could not help feeling, that this procession, so like an auto-da-fe, had more the character of revenge than of the salutary justice of the law.

The punishment had been mitigated at the earnest solicitation of the Brothers of the Misericordia. The coup de grace was immediately, inflicted, and the head of the criminal nearly severed from his body the head of the criminal nearly severed from his body at one stroke.* When the execution was over, the body was thrown carelessly over the wheel, (seemingly a common chariot wheel,) and a priest, in an impressive a common chariot wheel,) and a priest, in an impressive manner, addressed the mob from the scaffold, and then retired. The body continued thus exposed for some hours. I could not help feeling that if the sentence had been carried into full effect, it would have been toc been carried into full effect, it would have been toc sanguinary to suit the ends of public justice. Although it must be confessed, that if cruelty in punishment could ever be justified, it would be so when its object was to prevent the dreadful crime of assassinations. * The coup de grace was not usually given until every limb of the person condemned had been broken. He then received a violent blow, from the instrument used in breaking the limbs, upon the chest, which generally put an end to his sufferings. This was called the coup de grace, and the head was afterwards severed from the body.

Turin, though a very small city, considered as à capital, is yet a most princely place. It is much more regular than the Italian cities are in general: it is, however, modern, and retains none of those features of antiquity, which are to a city what nobility is to a family, an honour that casts a veil over many defects. Towards the centre, a noble square is formed by the Royal Palace, Government House, and other public edifices. From this square run, in straight lines, broad and handsome streets of from eighty to one hundred and handsome streets of from eighty to one hundred feet wide, and of simple but fine architecture. The windows of the houses are large, and the frequent balconies of the second story give a lively and splendid appearance to the whole. Workmen are now busily employed in converting the space, formerly occupied by the fortifications, into gardens, and public walks; which will prove a great embellishment, by opening, in every direction, the pleasing view of rich verdure and fine trees. The broadest and finest street of Turin lies in a direct line from the square, and terminates in a view of a handsome bridge, called the Bridge of the Po, which here passes the city. Turin is exactly what a child would design for the model of a city, having the King's Palace in the centre, with large and wide streets running towards it.

On the first landing-place of the palace stairs, there is an equestrian statue of Victor Amadeus, the horse trampling over slaves, who are beaten down under his hoofs—a barbarous conception! The figures of the slaves are well executed, but the statue itself is contemptible — The artist Trisian was a pupil of John of Bologna. The Palace of the Dukes of Savoy, situated in the same square, was erected in the year 1416: It received, in 1720, a new front by Juvara which has been much admired ; but chiefly, I suppose, because it is the only work of his, not altogether contemptible.

The interior has an air of melancholy grandeur. It was built by Vitozzi; and improved by Count Alfieri, in the year 1753. Its origin and name arose from a miracle. A sacrilegious soldier, having stolen tha small silver vase with the consecrated wafer, from a church in Chambery, proceded as far as Turin, where, helieving himself safe, he stopped with his mule; but, to his utter amazement, the vase suddenly sprang up into the air, where it obstinately remained, till the Bishop Romagno, by a solemn procession, and fervent prayer, persuaded it to descend into a consecrated chalice. To commemorate this cir¬ cumstance the church was built. Among the ancient works of art to be seen in Turin, there is a celebrated Egyptian table, which is shewn with much pride. It is composed of enamelled figures, partly lined with silver, on a dark copper-coloured ground ; and has once more found its way to Turin, after adventures probably as singular as those of any relic of Catholic times.It might be deemed little short of à miracle, that the soldiers, having begun to desace this precious monument, by picking out the silver, were deterred from proceeding; but this was fully as natural as miraculous : for they found the plates of silver difficult to pull off, being extremely thin, and in all the more delicate parts, little more than mère varnish of silver.

I find that one French author, Monsieur Millin adds another motive for the choice— « C'étoit, » he says, « sur le Peton le plus élevé des coteaux qui bordent le Po, dans le lieu qui semble plus s'approcher du ciel, »—that, being situated as near as possible to heaven, God might see his gratitude. There are however other motives for this choice, which may as safely be alledged: for it is not actually situated on the highest ground, but it is not actually situated on the highest ground, but the most picturesque and beautiful; the surrounding the most picturesque and beautiful; the surrounding country being seen in perspective, grouping around it, and so richly wooded, and studded with villas, that it seems like a prolongation of the city.

At a later period, this great work devolved on Pellegrini, an architect who, in many other un- dertakings, evinced taste and skill; but, on this occasion, by changing the original plan, and casting the great front with modern doors and windows, he destroyed the unity of character in the exterior of the edifice, the unity of character in the exterior of the edifice, without improving the aspect within, which is dark, mean, and paltry. A private individual, to make peace with Heaven on his death-bed, left a donation of 230,000 crowns to finish Pellegrini's plan ; but this great bequest was wasted, and the work still unaccomplished; insomuch, that before the French Revolution, there remained, of all the riches devoted to it, only the inadequate sum of 60,000 francs. Buonaparte, ever deligthted with any project which might bring celebrity to his name, furnished the necessary funds, to build the portal, and supply the ornaments which were wanting; and thus the edifice is nearly completed.

In the first, with the exception of the supporting columns and pillars, the whole lies in great conspicuous horizontal lines, as the beams, friezes, cornices, ceilings, etc.- in the latter all stands vertically, the terminations and in the latter all stands vertically, the terminations and ornaments spiral and upright; the frieze, cornice, or beams, which compose the uniting lines in the Grecian, being fremed , in the Saracenic, by the union and junction of closing arches; hence the lines of the Gothic are vertical, those of the Grecian horizontal. Any one slightly surveying the front of a Gothic Church must make this observation. Therefore the great question of taste on this subject seems to be, whather thin spiral, and perpendicnlar, or solid square, horizontal lines, are to be preferred. The former, perhaps, are the more are to be preferred. The former, perhaps, are the more pleasing for rich and splendid ornaments, the latter for the grand imposiug.

The conception of the artist is the finest, the most awful and grand imaginable; and the moment he has chosen, the most interesting, the most calculated to excite all the various sensations of curiosity, pain; wonder, and horror; it is when our Saviour says, « One among you shall betray me. » The picture is now nearly lost, and all its beauty gone; and this principally owing to the whimsical theories Leonardo had conceived in the composition, and manner of laying on his colours. He is reported to have been occupied sixteen years in this painting ; the chief part of which time was, I doubt not, employed in experiments more properly chemical; and, after having tried and rejected many materials, he at last finished the picture in oil, on a ground composed of pitch, mastic, and plaster, combined with some sourth ingredient, and wrought with heated iron; an invention probably altogether his own, but which was afterwards used by Sebastiano del Piombo. Over this preparation he laid his fresco a cement of burnt clay and ochre, which, being mixed up with varnish, formed a colouring of great beauty, but short duration.

He next proceeded to make separate sketches of the heads, of which two are still iu existence, one in the possession of Prince Lichtenstein, and the other the possession of Prince Lichtenstein, and the other purchased, a century ago, by an Englishman. A painting on a subject of such deep interest, and by an artist se eminent, could not fail to inspire the liveliest feelings among his friends and contemporaries ; but curiosity and enthusiasm, to whatever height they might have arisen, had no remedy but patience; for though this object constantly held the first place in the thoughts of Da Vinci, sixteen years elapsed before it was finally accomplished. Bernardo Zenale, on his expressing the difficulty of giving to the countenance of our Saviour a divine beauty and excellence, superior to that which he had already attained in those of some of the Apostles he had already attained in those of some of the Apostles particularly of St John, recommended him to follow the example of the celebrated Grecian artist, and leave the work unfinished; with which advice, according to one author (Lomazzo), he complied; but this statement is entirely contradicted by every other writer.* The description of the whole composition, given by Cardinal Frederic Borromeo, breathes all the fervour of a * Armenini says: The head of the Saviour did not remain impersect, but on the contrary was exquisitely finished.

In a public recitation, held by Antonio Massi, at Pavia, rather more than a hundred years since, he says. « Inimitable beauty shone in the Saviour’s countenance, blended with a character of deep and touching me- lancholy, expressive of celestial pity; a countenance on which the eye rested with awe, love, and admiration, while all the emotions of the mind, tenderness, anxiety, suspense, or fear, might be read in the varied aspects of'the Apostles. The mild and effulgent beauty of St John was relieved by the stronger and more dignisied physiognomy of St Peter, whose features, on which truth and zeal were pourtrayed, were finely contrasted by the haggard visage,dark scowling eye, wild disordered looks, and sunk cheek of Judas Iscariot, who is repre- sented, with the jealous suspicion characteristic of guilt, lo be listening to the discourse of St Peter. » During the progress of the work, the artist, as may easily be the progress of the work, the artist, as may easily be imagined, was assailed by the curiosity, or annoyed by the impatience, of those who surrounded him. It is reported, in particular, that the Prior, worn out with expectation, at length complained to the Duke, who, inquiring into the matter from Leonardo himself, was assured by him, that he devoted two hours daily to the painting ; and this answer being satisfactory, to the painting ; and this answer being satisfactory, the Prior was dismissed. But returning to the Duke the Prior was dismissed.

Leonardo was said to have revenged hiimself on the Prior, by making use ofhis countenance to represent Judas. It would be a long matter to enumerate the variety of accidents that have combined to ruin this celebrated picture, and those occurring at a period so shortly sollowing its completion, as to render it a subject of wonder, as a proof the exquisite heauty it had once possessed, that its fame has been carried through so many ages. Two circumstances have especially contri¬ buted to preserve it to posterity ; the admiration of contemporaries, who delighted in copying a favourite subject, and the diligence, taste, and talents of Morghen; and to these may be added, in the third place, the order, in the year 1797, by which Buonaparte prohi- bited the use of the hall any longer as a barrack.

This tribute is well due to the learned institutions whicb Thave visited in this elegant metropolis. The descriptions T had read of the college, its galleries, sculpture, and paintings, had given me a high idea of the edifice itself. I was, however, disappointed in the expectations T had formed. I looked for magnificent apartments, and princely halls; but I found them gloomy, the arches low and heavy, and the whole having a monastic cloistered aspect, somewhat depress¬ ing, yet not unsuitable to a seminary of science.

It is almost as colossal as the barriers of Neuilli, and infinitely more elegant than tbe Arch of the Carrousel, the effect of which is much injured of the Carrousel, the effect of which is much injured by its various colours, while this composed of the purest white marble. The design, however, much exceeds the execution ; the sculpture is indifferent, and the academic figures incorrect ; some conspicuous defect being perceptible in each, either from the too great length of arms, flatness of chest, or disproportioned size of the head, but yet, although critically imperfect, the effect of the whole is very striking.

I stood long gazing on this very beautiful picture, full of nature and feeling. The piece is composed of the Patriarch, Sarah, Hagar, and Ishmael, whom she is leading towards the desert; she has left her home, and is on her way, but looking back to Abraham. Her eyes reddened by the traces of tears, are fixed upon him with a sadness so deep, an expression so mournful of silent anguish, as is inexpressibly touching. In Abraham’s countenance may be read a manly sorrow, sussering, enduring, yet submitting. In the further end of the picture, Sarah is seen watching the lingering steps of Hagar with a look of malignant joy.

But the Ticino, which it crosses, is truly grand, rapid as the Rhone, and green as the sea, with beautiful banks, and interspersed with little islands. The general aspect of Pavia is desolate and mean; but some of its public edifices are well deserving of notice. The Borromean College, founded by St Charles Borromeo, is a superb institution. It is situated on an acclivity, the front rising conspicuous above a mass of wretched brick buildings. The entrance is by a gate, through which you pass into a court of about 15 feet square, encircled with arches supported by pillars, and on a second set of arches and pillars rising above and on a second set of arches and pillars rising above these, the gallery is built.

The composition and grouping is very masterly; the feelings and intentione of the surrounding figures being so finely expressed that each bears a proportionate part ; it is a tale told, not an unmeaning collection of figures, such as often sill the foregrounds of paintings in other respects good The figure of St Cecilia, especially, is finely drawn, and the colouring of the whole rich and beautiful. and the colouring of the whole rich and beautiful.

The vouthful but manly figure of Joseph, is contrasted by the softest expression of feminine beauty in Mary while the characteristic simplicity of both is a fine relief to the gorgeous costume, and the dignified aspect and demeanour, of the high priest. The countenance of a voung woman, who is seen just behind the Virgin, is distinguished by a most touching sweetness, mingled is distinguished by a most touching sweetness, mingled with a grandeur of expression very striking; one of the group, standiug behind Joseph, having his hands poised on his two thumbs, as he seems lost in the intensity from the fixed attention with which he regards the ceremony, although the posture is vulgar, it is represented with a truth to nature singularly efsective.

The composition and execution of this piece are both in tbe first style of excellence. The drawing of the figure of our Saviour is at once the most learned in point of anatomy, and the truest to nature T have ever seen; the figures of the Virgin, and the angels in the back ground, are in such keeping, as not in any degree to intrude on the picture, but are beautiful, and very natural.

The earnestness and interest of St Peter, while in the act of drawing the linen, with the mild and touching grief of Mary, are inexpressibly fine, as is the grand prophetic figure of St John: while the deepened tone of the horizon, its sombre hue, the indistinctness of the distance in the back ground, in which all seems silent and desolate, are very affecting.

The second is la Madonna di San Girolamo; and also most beautiful. The painting represents the Virgin sitting with the child on her knee, and Mary Magdalene at his feet, her countenance being raised towards him with an expression of lowliness, of love, and adoration most forticibly and tenderly expressed; his hand is thrust into her hair with playful infantine grace, while an angel on his left hand seems endeavouring to attract an angel on his left hand seems endeavouring to attract his attention. St Jerome forming the balance of the group, stands on the other side. The colouring of this picture is very rich.* The third is the martyrdom of Santa Placida, and her sister Santa Flavia.

In this room, we find a small picture, representing the Ascension, finely executed. Our Saviour is seated in the Heavens, with the Virgin and St John, one on in the Heavens, with the Virgin and St John, one on either side; and St Paul and St Catherine in adoration below.

Correggio was esteemed the first great master of the school of Parma of that period. Francesco Mazzuola, styled Parmigianino the second; but the sweetness and grace of that artist is ascribed more to his study of Raffaelo, than to his imitations of Correggio. His famous work of the Adoration of the Magi, is held to be the finest of his pictures. Among the works of art in this city, the fresco paintings by Hannibal Caracci, in the Palazzo del Giar¬ dino, excite great interest. This residence, which is beautifully situated just beyond the walls of the city, was entirely pillaged during the period of the Revolution, and as we ascended fine stair-cases, and passed through and as we ascended fine stair-cases, and passed through noble apartments, we could only perceive how delight- ful it had been.

Seated on the highest summit of the Ap- penines, it overlooks the brow of a mountain, which, although covered with trees, is almost perpendicular; while on the plain far below lies the beautiful vale of Arno, bound by a circle of magnificent hills, sometimes rising in acclivities, sometimes in polished knolls or bold promontories, cultivated te the very summit with the vine and olive, interspersed with fruit and forest trees, and thickly studded with villas, convents, and churches, presenting an aspect of extraordinary anima¬ tion and beauty.

The imagination unconsciously embodies the aspect of Florence with its history, and the recollection of what it has been, seems to form an integral part with its present appearance. The mind dwells on the days of other times, their troubles, horrors, and glories; and the fancy not unwillingly rests on the early pictures of a city, whose ardent spirit, ambition, and genius, thus produced an eventful and ever-changing scene.

Wefiud, in tracing the earlier periods of Florentine history, a wide field for speculation, where, though much is left to conjecture, there is likewise much to much is left to conjecture, there is likewise much to interest the philosopher, and to excite the imagination. The Florentines appear to have been a bold and inge- nious race; and we are led to attribute the fearful feuds which convulsed the city, staining her streets with blood, and darkening the pages of her annalists no less to the result of national character, than to the effect of moral causes bearing upon a high-minded people, fighting for renown and independence. The love of science and the arts, for which they have been so peculiarly distinguished, and which was constantly found mingling with all their warlike habits and passions, bespeaks a high strain of genius, which still serves to ennoble and adorn their eventful history. Florence should be the very school of the fine arts. Even in the period when Italy shone brightest in mental powers—when science and learned men enlighrened the rest of Europe, Florence, high in the scale of the rest of Europe, Florence, high in the scale of recorded merit, enjoyed pre-eminence. To the distinc¬ tions of splendid talent she added a sedulous application to the sources of wealth.

The elevated station which this republic attained, and which, for a season, shed such lustre on her name, had its hirth in the combined influence of the talent, wisdom, wealth, and magnificent spirit, which adorned the House of Medici. Yet it was by slow stages that she rose to such distinction: centuries of devastation, turbulence, and bloodshed, preceded this luminous era. + * . .* TUSCAN ARCHITECTURE. The Tuscan architecture may be described as pre¬ senting the image of simple grandeur. Strength and power have been considered as the sole guides on which the Etruscan architect founded his principles; but if force, security, and the means of defence, were originally his only objects, these soon gave place to a higher sentiment, combining nobleness with strength. The great masters who flourished in the time of Cosmo de Medici, could not be ignorant of Grecian architecture; but, while introducing Grecian ornaments. it is evident they acted on the principle of perpetuating the Etruscan style, the most prominent features of the Etruscan style, the most prominent features of which, I should say, were the vast stones, the noble square forms of their edifices, and their deep, heavy, projecting cornices. + The Author had made notes for a sketch of the history of Florence, but as these had not undergone any revision by himself, the Editor has nôt published them.

The masters of that period retained the bases of the Etruscan, varied by the Roman and the bases of the Etruscan, varied by the Roman and Grecian; but still the original style is to be traced in all their most finished buildings, a style powerful, and peculiarly marked by strength. It was hereditary, and they were fond of it; it was grand, and it pleased them; it suited the warm climate in its courts and halls, and was adapted to warlike times, from the depth and strength of its walls. Strabo says, the most ancient Tuscan buildings were great masses of hewn stones, built without cement, such as neither weather nor time could destroy, In the noble edifices and palaces erected in the first ages of restored art, the Florentines have maintained the simple square forms, and grand models of earlier times. They have retained the ground stone line, the coarse rustic base, the large stones, the iron rings, the stone seat, the massiveness, squareness, and the grand projecting cornice above, giving shelter from the glowing light of the mid-day sun. Every house was a garrison; and the city had that gloomy cast, which all the splendour of the Ducal court, and of the embassies of foreign powers, and her excellence in art, have not entirely changed. The walls round Florence form a circumference of five miles, and, in ancient times, were guarded by sixtech towers, having an equal number of gates. In                                "

The passage across each bridge was defended by similar edifices; so as were many of the palaces and houses of individuals. The effect of these towers must indeed have been singularly striking and grand; an observation we find made in the Viaggio Pittorico where the destruction of these ancient monuments, which guarded the walls of Florence, is mentioned with much regret. Their removal, or at least the diminishing of their number, in the interior of the city, which took place at the same period, Machiavelli mentions as having been a most salutary measure, not only as it lessened the temptation to civil broils, but also rendered the air more salubrious; the ravages of the plague, with which the city had been so often afflicted, being supposed to arise from the obstruction to ventilation which they occasioned.* The only vestiges of these antique buildings are to be found on * The only vestiges of these antique buildings are to be found on Mount San Miniato, which bears on Porta San Niccolò. In the year 1525, this tower, even then partly in ruins, was converted into a regular fort by Michael Angelo Buonarroti. The moment was most interesting. The people, willing to regain that liberty which they thought had been invaded by some ofthe measures of Alexander, one of the descendants of the Medici, had dispossessed him of his authority, and banished him of the Medici, had dispossessed him of his authority, and banished him the city.

It is a peculiar and integral style, different from every other a peculiar and integral style, different from every other that is derived from earlier times, and of which, Arnolpho, if he did not find it in Fiesole, must be considered the inventor.

PALAZZO DEL PODESTA, OR IL BARGELLO.

These were the Gonfaloniere,* whose special duty wasto administer justice; l’Esecutore, to preside over criminal causes; and il Capitano, to protect and support these in the administration of their several departments. The office of Esecutore was a new charge, having effect for the first time at the period of the erection of the Podestà, and was filled by Matteo dei Terribili d’Amelia. We are told that this palace was the first whose decorations displayed a rising taste for the arts; but its magnificence was not of long duration. Towards the year 1299, the seat of government was removed to Palazzo Vecchio, at which time this edifice was converted into a prison, and took the appellation of Il Bargello. The severe and gloomy grandeur peculiar to the style of Arnolfo accorded well with the disorderly times of the republic.

The magistrates and rulers , often the victims of these discontents, found safety only in vigilance and cruelty, and sought to supply by secret measures their defect of power. At the portal of the palace gate was placed a silent monitor, termed Tamburazione * through whose medium, as in the horrible era of revolutionary France, secret communications were conveyed to the state. The denunciation of the noble, or the citizen, was a safe and simple process.

It appears that the original plan designed by Arnolfo for this building was finer than that finally adopted. It united symmetry with grandeur and would have enabled him to plant the building, which now stands obliquely, in fair and just proportion. But he met with insurmountable obstacles. Among the buildings to be thrown down to clear a sufficient space for this great fabric, the habi¬ tations of the Uberti, attached to theGhibellini faction. were designated, and it was in vain that the architect reasoned or entreated; he could not prevail with the people to suffer that any part or portion of the National Palace should touch the ground which these habitations had occupied; and while thus obstinate in their an tipathies, their prediction in fayour of the antique tower of the Tiraboschi della Vacca led them to insist on it being incorporated in the buildings.

The body of the Centaur is admirably wrought, and he kicks well, with his right leg against the knee of Hercules; but the whole is deficient in spirit and action.

Many a pile of this majestic nature is justly termed Gothic, though all are so unlike each other ; but the epithet may be regarded chiefly as applying to a particular period of antiquity, the period of romance, of caprice, and varied fantastic forms, of romance, of caprice, and varied fantastic forms, before the noble architecture of Greece was revived, and when the art had a general character, but no fixed order or determined proportions. TheDuomo does not possess the beauty of lightness, or of elegance, in which respect it differs greatly from the Cathedral of Milan ; neither does it possess the friezes, nor rich and many-coloured pannels of the Certosa; yet the character, although so dissimilar in form, belongs to the same class. The great front exhibits three gates of Gothic archi¬ tecture, the arches of which are small and much pointed. There are also four lateral entrances, two at each side of the church. The aisles are divided from the nave by ranges of large grouped Gothic columns, with swelling capitals of rustic form, and rich with leaves. Superb arches springing from these, but resting on a firm base, rise to such an enormous height, that in the gloom                                "

From Arnolfo and his celebrated successors, Giotto, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Orgagna, Masaccio, etc. to Michael Angelo, gradual changes may be traced in the architecture of Florence, which might not prove uninteresting, but which would hardly suit with the general views and slight sketches to which Thave limited myself.

This edifice, from its magnificence, deserves the attention of the artist ; exciting interest as being the cradle of the Medicean family, with whom all that was elegant and learned in Florence arose, and as presenting a noble specimen of the mixed architecture, which a noble specimen of the mixed architecture, which                               "

Palazzo Riccardi was erected after a design of Miche- lozzo, in the year 1431, by Cosmo, styled Pater Patriœ, and was the residence of the Medici till the year 1540, when it was abandoned for the Palazzo Vecchio. As you enter Via Larga, you behold the front of this fine building, a grand imposing mass, in a long extended perspective of six hundred and sixty feet. The base, or first stage of the building, rising to the height of thirty feet, is of the Doric order, with the height of thirty feet, is of the Doric order, with à narrow rude cornice, which assimilates well with the massiveness of the whole, and marks its termination. The second stage, or Piano nobile, is composed of à finer, or more polished rustic; the windows are arched, and divided in the middle by a small Gothic column, with a Corinthian capital, so that it may be styled the Corinthian disposed in the Gothic order. The third floor resembles the second, having the same arched windows, and mixed architecture, terminated by a bold projecting cornice, giving character and grandeur to the whole edifice. In the original architec- ture of this palace, the base, rising to thirty feet, presented one unbroken space, entire as a Cyplopian wall, varied only by the projection of the vast and rudely-chiseled stones of which it was composed; the whole bearing an aspect more resembling that of an impregnable fortress, than a princely abode. This vast space at a later period assumed its present form, being opened with large windows by Michael                                "

This artist was attached to the Greek archi¬ tecture; and, except when called upon to improve some of the great and rude works of the earlier periods, rarely condescended to mix the Greek and Tuscan. He delighted in the purest and most simple forms of the Grecian orders, laying flat pilasters on the fronts the Grecian orders, laying flat pilasters on the fronts of his buildings, and these generally Doric. He never gave in to the gorgeous style, as may be seen in his staircase and hall for the Laurentian Library, crowded, but simple in all its characters, as also in the palace which he built in this city; one of the most simple and chaste designs l'have ever seen, for the town residence of a nobleman. Palazzo Strozzi is a noble edifice of three stories bearing the gradations in the rustic, similar to those of the Grecian style ; namely, strong and coarse rustic work below, finer and more delicate in the second story, polished in the third, and the whole surmounted by a noble cornice. Palazzo Pitti, now styled Palazzo Reale, designed by Palazzo Pitti, now styled Palazzo Reale, designed by Brunelleschi, was originally intended for the residence of a private individual, owing its origin to a principle which had a conspicuous influence on the minds of the Florentines, namely, the desire of commanding the Florentines, namely, the desire of commanding respect by the bulk and splendour of their residence. We find the Strozzi avowedly erecting an edifice, the vastness of which should carry down their name with honour to their posterity ; and Luca Pitti, urged by a similar feeling, (though of more immediate fulfilment.) raising Palazzo Pitti, that he might outshine the Medici,                                "

Many cir¬ cumstances combined to give celebrity to this palace; the popularity enjoyed at its first commencement, by the projector, was such, that artists and workmen claimed no reward for their services, except that of being styled his friends and partizans; the distinguished name of the chief artist ; and lastly, its enormous bulk. But setting aside such impressions, as may owe their source to enthusiasm or prejudice, I should describe Palazzo Pitti as a vast, rude, and shapeless pile : possessing no beauty from proportion, nor distinguished by any peculiarity of character in architecture. The rustic, which gives strength, form, and colour to a base, is in this building carried over the whole front, producing one dull and uniform aspect. The gate is ordinary, and little conspicuous in this solid heavy mass; unvaried by any projection, except a gallery of coarse architecture, which ruins along the second floor. The third differs in nothing from the others; nor is it even relieved by the bold cornice, which gives character to so many of the palaces of this city. The cortile, or colonnade, gracefully branching out from each side of the palace, was erected at a later period by Ammannato, and is executed in the finest style, and in the noblest proportions, being equally distinguished for grandeur and elegance. The base pre- sents a splendid colonnade of magnificent dimensions with Jonic columns and semicolumns. The second Iloor is composed of Doric semicolumns, supporting arches, finely drawn, and well executed, over square                                "

The object of this construction was to produce an assimilation of character with the rustic work of the palace; but it was surely a wretched invention. In the Quaratesi Palace we find a fine specimen of the composite Tuscan, combining with the grandest the composite Tuscan, combining with the grandest character of this order, a well-assimilated portion of the Grecian character.

The windows, nine feet in front, are very magnificent; each is divided in the centre by a slender Corinthian column, supporting a wide-spread arch, which- is surmounted by beautifully wrought and vreathed festoons of vine leaves. The cortile is also of good architecture, having composed columns, with rich and curious capitals. The Palazzo now inhabited by Chev. Fossombroni, in Canto Dei Pazzi, offers a conspicuous specimen of the alliance of the Greek and Tuscan style; the lofty the alliance of the Greek and Tuscan style; the lofty and magnificent façade of this edifice being nobly sup¬ ported by the weight and gravity of the Tuscan base.

I have already said that Florence was a city of palaces, and insensibly, in pursuit of my favourite study, I have been led to enumerate a number, encroaching upon the limits to which I have endeavoured to restrict myself. The interior of many of these palaces presents not only fine architecture, but also many valuable works of art; but nothing of that character of splendour, richness, and brilliancy, which prevailed at the earlier period, when the master, with his partizans and followers, had but one interest, and made, as it were, one family LOGGIA DEI LANZI In seeking for those specimens of architecture most worthy of attention in Florence, the arcade styled Loggia dei Lanzi, is an object of peculiar interest from its singular beauty and magnificence. It was usual in the early periods of this republic, and the practice was one in which they followed the ancients, to provide a space close to the government house, or seat of power, a space close to the government house, or seat of power, where the whole body of the people might meet in one great assembly, to take their share in public affairs, to which they were summoned by the tolling of the to which they were summoned by the tolling of the great bell of the city.

The erection of this edifice naturally excited great interest; and the object accordingly was pursued with that zeal and emulation, which then so peculiarly characterized this people. At the conclusion of many debates, and keen discussions, the design presented by Orgagna, an artist celebrated for his singular at- tainments in the three sister arts, architecture, sculpture, and painting, was preferred.

Two noble shaggy lions, antiques brought from Rome, in the year 1788, the size of life, executed in white marble, stand on either side of the porch, as if guarding the entrance; and lining the walls of the arcade are six statues, also antique, representing Sabine priestesses, of a colossal size, magnificent in attitude and drapery. In front, under each arch of the colonnade, stand three separate groups, by celebrated masters. The first is the Rape of the Sabine; by John of Bologna.

The youth, whose figure is formed in the finest proportions, full of strength and manly vigour, not only lifts the young female from the ground, but holds her high in his arms, starting from the grasp of the old man, while she is struggling with uplifted hands, as if to break from his hold. All this finely told, and constitutes a group of great merit, which, especially when beheld in a front view, is very fine. There is however, a fault in the composition of the work, which is to be regretted, as essentially injuring its beauty. The figures are not well balanced, but rise perpendicularly, one over the other, in a manner that reminds you of an exhibition of strength in a circus; so that, viewing it from a distance, you can hardly conceive how such a group can stand. The original idea conceived by the artist was to describe the three periods of human existence, vouth, manhood, and old age; but he was persuaded to change his intention, and to style the group the Rape of a Sabine. The base is richly adorned with a basso relievo, finely executed, by the sane artist, explaining the subject, and telling the tale of the Rape of the Sabines. The second, a beautiful statue in bronze, with the Medusa, is the Perseus of Benvenuto Bellini. Ie is represented as having just cut off the head of Medusa,                                "

The head with the winged helm is noble, and the countenance princely. The posture is fine, the action full of animation and life, the forms powerful, and free from all affectation of science, in knobs, joints, and muscles. The whole is gracefully simple, and executed with such elegance and beauty of proportion, that, although it is fully seven feet Ligh, it has the effect of a light youthful figure, not exceeding the usual size. So truly do I admire the Perseus, that I feel unwilling to point out any of its faults ; it must, however, be remarked, that the head and body of Medusa are represented streaming with blood, with a revolting exaggeration, which is neither true to nature nor good taste; that the fallen body of the sorceress is too much mangled, and uncouthly bundled up below the feet of Perseus; as also that, instead of being thrown on of Perseus; as also that, instead of being thrown on the naked rock, it lies on a velvet cushion. The third group is that of Judith and Holofernes, by Donatello. This artist possesses a high reputation. but on the present occasion he has totally failed. The subject is one into which the utmost skill could not infuse interest, but yet might exhibit grandeur or science. Both, however, arc wanting, and the work is almost contemptible.
