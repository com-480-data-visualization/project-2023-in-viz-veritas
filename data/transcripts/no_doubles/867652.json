Amongst whichs as the subterraneous city Herculaneum is the most considerable, it is treated in so parti¬ cular a manner, that the following Account, added to the former, may be justly affirmed to be the least imperfect that has been hi¬ therto drawn up: as containing every thing material relating to the ancient state of that city, to the eruptions of Vesuvius which caused its destruction, to the gradual disco¬ veries ol it from time to time, and to the numerous curiosities that have been found therein.

This formal Description of so many ex¬ traordinary rarities was transmitted to Rome, in hopes of receiving some confirmation of it in hopes of receiving some confirmation of it from thence: but the answer brought the strongest assurances, that upon the strictest inquiry made at Naples, and at Portici, no such person as Mr. GEORGE BEHN had re¬ sided at the former, nor any such pictures had ever been seen at the latter. Upon which, the Author of these Letters was pressed to hasten the additional Account he had promised to give of these Antiquities, and thereby prevent the impositions of such Romantic Historians. To render this undertaking the less diffi¬ cult to him, Three Pieces were publisned the same year, one in French, and tyo in Italian.

And for this choice he could not but be sufficiently qua¬ lified, by having made three visits to this subterraneous Town himself, and viewed the Collection at Portici three several times. He justly preferred this method to an intire translation of any one of these Pieces: which, on account both of superfluities in some re¬ † Notizie del memorabile scoprimento delll antica città Erco¬ lano vicina Napoli, &c.

As Antiquarians are generally more indu¬ strious in the collection, than curious in the disposition, of their materials: so in open¬ ing and shewing their Treasuries, they do ing and shewing their Treasuries, they do not display them in so advantageous a man¬ ner, as to attract, detain, and delight the eyes of the Spectators. A desire of giving more of the Spectators. A desire of giving more satisfaction than is necessary, by exhibiting a multiplicity of objects at once, induces them to deviate into frequent digressions, wherein to deviate into frequent digressions, wherein the variety of their Observations renders the variety of their Observations renders things less conspicuous; like too many arti¬ ficial lights in a room, which, if not art¬ fully disposed, are apt to spread a dusky gloominess round about. From this imputation of obscurity, and consequently of tediousness, the Marquiss Book is not intirely free: which made it concluded, that a Translation of it in En¬ glish was not likely to be acceptable. But others, it seems, being of a different opi¬ nion, have lately advertised two different Translations, one of which is by GEORGE WHITE, "

This Correspondence consists onely of three short Pieces. – The first is part of a Programma by GESNER in Sept. 1747. in which, he first takes notice of the re¬ in Sept. 1747. in which, he first takes notice of the re¬ ports spred about in the common News-papers of the discovery of this subterraneous City, wherein were found houses furnished, and men and women intire in their proper habits; then expresses his hopes, that some Library will be discovered, in which there may be found perhaps a perfect Diodorus Siculus, Polybius, Sallustius, Livius, or Tacitus, the latter Part of OVIDIs Fasti, or the Elder PLINYIS twenty books of the wars of Ger the Elder PLINYIS twenty books of the wars of Ger many; and in the last place exhorts the King of the Two Sicilies to employ his army in making farther dis¬ coveries. –The second Piece is part of a Letter from Cardinal QUIRINI to FEVERLINUS, a Professor at the University of Gottenburgh, wishing that the same books may be found, informing him that he himself was pub¬ lishing a DION CASSIUS, and mentioning two other persons ingaged in a new edition of the same Author.

            "xii PREFACE. This the Summ total of this noble ad¬ dition of Literary Correspondence: which does not take up five pages in a large print; in which there is nothing particular recommend¬ ing these Antiquities as of the greatest use to Learning; and which indeed is no Literary Correspondence at all, there being onely very short extracts of two Letters, which have no manner of relation to each other. Such fallacious Advertisements are as certain a mark of Quackery in writing, as in the practice of Physic. As this subterraneous City must needs prove to his Sicilian Majesty an inexhausti¬ ble mine of real Antiquities, so it will open a large and fruitsul field for imposture to the a large and fruitsul field for imposture to the Virtuosos and dealers in fictitious ones. On which account, whoever professes to make a show of statues, pictures, &c. pretending a show of statues, pictures, &c. pretending Ehen to have been dug up from the ruins of this place, especially if they demand money for the Sight, ought to give a very particular and clear account how they came into his possession; since it is highly probable, that they either are not genuine, or if they be, they either are not genuine, or if they be, that they were conveved from thence in a clandestine and surreptitious manner.

Next to this column stands a lion in mar¬ I ble; on the pedestal an inscription to ADRIAN. In * This Inscription was written about the year of Rome 494, and 258 before CHRIST, being counted the most an¬ cient in the same language extant in the world. The most remarkable peculiarities in it are: C is always put for G, which letter was not at that time invented, as leciones for as legiones; D is added at the end of a word after a vowel, as marid for mari; S is inserted in the middle of a word, as triresmos for triremos; the consonants are never doubled, clases for classes; poplo is put for populo. As to the vowels, E stands for I, as cepet for cepit; and O for U, as Consol for Consul. CIACONIUS explains the inscription in the man¬ ner following. Caius Duilius Marci filius Consul adversus Carthaginienses in Sicilia Rem gerens, Egestanos Lsocios atque cognatos) Populi Romani artissima Obsidione exemit.

DONINO INVICIO NOSIRO AVCVSTO MAXENTIO VII PIO FELICI Thave copied these inscriptions just as they are; but the blunders in the letters and false spelling must be attributed, partly to the ignorance or care¬ lessness of thework-man, and partly to time, which may have carried off part of some of the letters. These errors and defects one often meets with in antique inscriptions, which make it sometimes very difficult to understand them. You see in this last inscription, that there is in DOMINO an N instead of an M, in NOSTRO an 1 instead of a N instead of an M, in NOSTRO an 1 instead of a T, and in the like manner in INVICTO, and a C instead of a G in AVCVSTO.

This basso relievo, thous badly executed, has some thing very singular; for which reason, I here give a description of it. DIANUMENIANUS lies along upon the cover of it, holding two poppys in his hand; where likewise stands a dog: at one corner is a figure of a boy, or child, holding some leaves in one hand, and in the other a bird: "

Below, on the front of the urn, and in the middle, sits on the front of the urn, and in the middle, sits PROMETHEUS, having in his right hand a thing like a modelling tool, and with the other hold¬ ing the figure of a child, or man, as forming him; at his feet stands one already formed up¬ on a pedestal: MINERVA stands on one side, on a pedestal: MINERVA stands on one side, and puts upon the head of the person forming, an animal like a grashopper; close to MINERVA an animal like a grashopper; close to MINERVA sits an owl, and under that a head or mask like a Fury: on one side, behind PROMETHEUS, is a woman, who touches with a stick, or radius, a globe or ball, placed upon a pillar, round a globe or ball, placed upon a pillar, round which globe are two circular lines; in her lest hand she holds a little pot, which perhaps re¬ presente the taking fire from heaven, &c.

Over this a fi¬ gure (AURORA I suppose) in a chariot, Iooking up, and drawn by four horses mounting, al¬ luding to the birth of man; under the horses is a figure of AEOLUS blowing a horn: she rises is a figure of AEOLUS blowing a horn: she rises out of the lap of the figure of an old man, not unlikely OCEANUS, under whose lest hand comes out a dragon or serpent: below, and close to PROMETHEUS, lies a figure of Abundantia or Terra, F 3 "

For among the Athenians, every citizen was obliged to write down upon a piece of a tile the name of any person, who seemed to be in such a way, as to be able some time or to be in such a way, as to be able some time or other to exercise tyranny over his fellow-citizens: but among the Syracusians, to write the name of each over-grown citizen upon an olive-leaf; and the leaves being counted, he, whose name appeared upon * Τῶν ἀνδρῶν τυρανίδος ἐσπιθυμούντων, ὁ δῆμος ἐπηνέχθη μι¬ μήσασθαι τοὺς ἀθηναίους, καὶ νόμον θεῖναι παράπλήσιον τῷ παρ ἐκείνοις γεγραμμένῳ περì ὀστρακισμοῦ. παρὰ γὰρ ἀθηναίοις ἕκα¬ στον τῶν πόλιτυν ἔδει γράφειν εἰς ὅστρακον τούνομα τοῦ δοκοῦντος μάλιστα δύνασθαι τυραννεῖν τῶν πολιτῶν· παρα δὲ τοῖς συρα¬ κουσίοις εἰς πέταλοῳ ἐλαίας γράφεσθαι τὸν δυνατώτατον τῶν πο¬ λιτῶν· διαριθμηθέντων δὲ τῶν πετάλων, τὸν πλεῖστα πέταλα λα¬  βῶτα, φεύγειν πενταετῇ χρόνον.

The Genius here in the cloak has a little square tablet in his hand in which one may discern a certain confused mark; which seems to denote the name of the condemned person, which was written upon it: as one reads in the Lise of ARISTIDES.

In imitation of the Athenians, and Syracusians, the Romans also used to give their votes by tablets, on which were one of these tyo letters A.

The shell, which lies below in the middle, is the thing, Sir, which has entirely confirmed me in the opi¬ nion, that the ingenious artificer had a design to express in this Cameo the Ostracism of the Athenians. It is certain, that the Ostracism took its namè from the word ὄστρακον, which sig¬ nifies testa, or the fragment of a vase, or tile; such as that appears to be, which the boy in the cloak holds in his hand, in which they wrote the names of those whom they banished. On the names of those whom they banished. On this occasion, at first they made use of small pieces of pitchers, or broken vases, afterwards of small tiles.

If this explication be probable, which Thope it may be allowed to be, till some other per¬ son shall produce one which may seem more likely; this singular Cameo is deservedly fallen into the hands of an English Gentleman; of a nation, which, for the spirit of liberty, as well as for arts and sciences, may be justly compared with the most celebrated states of Greece, in their most flourishing times. But re-addressing myself to you, most noble Sir, as a citizen born free in the midst of a most wise and prudent Republic; what judgment do you form con¬ cerning this custom of the Athenians? as for my part, I cannot but highly disapprove it. It is true, that this Ostracism was instituted, on purpose to deliver the citizens of Athens from the tyranny of certain potent and seditious men; but the just apprehension of tyranny degenerated soon into a servile fear; and that chastisement, which was invented solely for the punishment of "

            "LETTER XLVII. 80 of the seditious, began to be extended towards all those, who possessed extraordinary qualities, capable of exciting the envy of others. In short, this fear was that which always haunted the Athenians, and induced them to oppress the Athenians, and induced them to oppress men, how illustrious soever for virtue and me¬ rit; depriving often the Republic of the service of the most able citizens, whom they chose ra¬ ther to chastise tho’ innocent, than not endea¬ vour to extinguish their own unreasonable fears and jealousies. Thus CORNELIUS NEPOS con¬ cludes his Lise of MILTIADES, * The people, re¬ flecting upon these things, were more willing that he should be punished, than that themselves should he should be punished, than that themselves should continue longer under their apprehensions. And this the reason, why one meets in Greece with so many sad instances of the like nature. Who is ignorant, that an ARISTIDES was driven away from his countrey for his justice; that a DAMON, the master of PERICLES, was found guilty for having too much wisdom; that a PTOLOMY was hated for being too happy? A THEMISTOCLES, an ALCIBIADES, a THUCYDIDES, and many others demonstrate, that to be virtu¬ ous and rich was oftentimes a crime; verifying the observation of TACITUS, † Nobility, posts of * Haec populus respiciens, maluit eum innoxium plecti, quàm se diutius esse in timore. se diutius esse in timore. † Nobilitas, opes, omissi gestiquè honores pro crimine; et ob virtutes certissimum exitium.

Tknow that some moderns have approved of the Ostracism, and seem unvilling to disap¬ prove even of the banishment of good citizens, according to the political government of some Republics. And really, if one contemplates with an indifferent eye the most potent, we shall observe a regulated order in nature, by which some seem born to obey, and others to command; from whence Tinfer, that one ought not to discompose this destiny; or providence of nature. This philosophical reason I take to be true, as long as he that is able to govern does not makè himself a judge of his own abilities, and does not forcibly procure that authority, which he thinks belongs to him; because then he will not be a virtuous citizen, but will be¬ he will not be a virtuous citizen, but will be¬ come a seditious person, and a tyrant.

S there is a dispute concerning the situa¬ Ation of the Tarpeian rock, and the prison formerly called Tullianum, both very near the Capitol; I shall here venture to give you my opinion, which is submitted with all imaginable deference to the superior judgment of others. As to the former, the place generally shewn by Antiquaries, is a precipice or piece of a rock, about twenty foot high, which lies on the north¬ west side of the Capitol, near to the corner of the palace of CAFARELLI; and which overlooks a convent called Torre de Specchi, and is joined a convent called Torre de Specchi, and is joined at the bottom to the little church of S. URSU¬ LA. But according to the opinion of the an¬ cients, one ought to look for it on the south¬ east side towards the Forum Romanum, and the Palatine hill, at the end of the hill called now Monte Caprino: and whoever takes the pains to observe the situations, can not but be of the same opinion. Texamined both these precipices with great exactness: that on the north-west side is more easy of access, and appears more to view; which may perhaps be the reason, that tis "

It is very steep and craggy; and thoo by the continu¬ al fall of ruins the height is much diminished, al fall of ruins the height is much diminished, vet is it not a thing so despicable as BURNET represents it. Under this precipice one Signor PHILIPPO LEONE has a house and garden; into which I entered, and found, that there runs a large ca¬ vity a great way under the rock. However, this person was of opinion, that the true Tar¬ peian rock lay on the other side towards Monte Caprino: which, he said, was not onely the opinion of the ancients, but was confirmed by tradition, and by the present inhabitants. He directed me to a garden on Monte Caprino, where there is a place in which they play at bowls, a game called il jocalitio: at the end of which garden there is a very craggy and steep precipice, almost perpendicular; which hangs over the piazza of the church della Consolatione, and to me seems much higher than that on the north-west. LIVY gives an account of the steep¬ ness and craggyness of this south- east precipice, ness and craggyness of this south- east precipice, and among other circumstances relates that * 6 a piece of the rock tumbled down, and killed : several people in the Vicus Jugarius,33 which lay * Saxum ingens, sive imbribus, sive motu terrae leviore, quàm ut alioqui sentiretur, labefactatum, in vicum Jugarium ex Capitolio procidit, et multos oppressit.

This seems to be a strong proof, that this place was reputed the Tarpeian rock, 'till of late years. ––– A road from the piazza della Consolatione, leading up to the Capitol, on one side of this precipice, is still called by the inhabitants Via Tarpeia: and on the wall of a house is fixed the following inscrip¬ the wall of a house is fixed the following inscrip¬ tion in honour of Pope GREGORY XIII. with two verses varied from VIRGIL.

Not to tire you with the disputes on this subject, I shall onely observe, that so on this subject, I shall onely observe, that so large a city as Rome certainly required more prisons than one; and that the situation of that which LIVY mentions answers very well to the re¬ mains of an old deep grotta, which is to be seen in a passage leading from Monte Caprino to the in a passage leading from Monte Caprino to the kitchen of the palace of CAFARELLI, and is com¬ posed of large square stones, and strong old walls, &c. and which, for its nearness to the precipice of Monte Caprino, might be very properly said to be imminens foro, as * LIVY describes it.

They were to be seen for¬ merly among the orange trees in the garden of the little Farnese palace in Transtevere; from whence, by order of Don Carlos, they were re¬ moved about the year 1735.

The Inscription is above two thousand three hundred years old, and was first taken notice of by Dr. WILLIAM SHERARD, afterwards by the Rev.

The Chi differs from the more modern X, as the crux immissa from the crux decussata, or our the crux immissa from the crux decussata, or our Saviour’s cross from that of S. ANDREW. Which difference might naturally arise from the carelessness of writers, who, by little and little varving the old form, reduced it at last to the figure it bears at present. For as the change from † to X is almost insensible, and would inevitably happen from inaccuracy, ca¬ price, or expedition; so the same causes, with the same facility, would produce a change from X to X: and when the traverse beam had altered its position, and was lengthened to an equality with the other, it was natural to de¬ scribe the other proportionably oblique and inclining, so as that the whole might make a more uniform and regular appearance; whence we have the present figure X.

In both, the H is used onely for an aspirate; in both the Epsilon serves to express the long and short E; in both the Omicron stands for O, Q, and OT.

Thus he uses the O and the X, which had no place among the Cadmean letters, but were invented by PALA¬ MEDES about the time of the Trojan war; and uses neither the H nor O, neither the Z nor 1, because they were invented by SIMONIDES six hundred and fifty years after. Not that SIMO¬ NIDES really invented the H, which must have been in use even before the time of PALA¬ MEDES, in as much as before he invented the O, P, and X, it was joined with the T, II, and K, to express those letters, thus, TH, IIH, KH; and it is also used for an aspirate, but not for the Eta or long E in this very Inscription of HERODES: But SIMONIDES is called the inven¬ tor VOL.

PETER?S was so much impaired by time, that it was thought necessary to applie some immediate remedy. Accordingly five hoops of iron were fixed round it, on the outside, to brace and hold it fast together. There were no fewer than fifty cracks running and dispersing themselves here and there, being visible to the eye within here and there, being visible to the eye within the church; and some of them were so wide the church; and some of them were so wide that they passed quite through, and in one I could lay three of my fingers. To repair these, à scaffolding was necessary; but to make one from the pavement of the church to the top, would have been not onely vastly expensive, but like wise very inconvenient; especially as the great altar stands just under the center of the cupola. To avoid both these objections, ZA¬ BAGLIA made a scaffolding, which had its base or foundation upon the cornice of the church, or foundation upon the cornice of the church, which goes round where the cupola begins. On this cornice he laid out tyo beams, and upon these beams run up the whole scaffold, concave wise, quite to the lantern; so that the upper part hung perpendicular: and, what is very extraordinary, he made no holes in the walls to receive the ends of the timber; but the whole was so well connected, that it was supported was so well connected, that it was supported entirely "

He added, that the Gentlemen of your profession exclaimed much against these waters as very dangerous, onely because a person now and then happens to burst, upon their not passing, and goes into the other world without their pass-port: nay, the other world without their pass-port: nay, that they had proceeded so far in their spite and malice, as to procure dead cats and dogs to be thrown into this place, on purpose to hinder people from resorting to it.

At Tralles a city of Lydia, famous for the temple of Vic¬ tory, and for the prodigy pretended to have happened there before the battle of Pharsalia, the painter APATURIVS had made a decoration for the stage according to the same rules: in explaining which, LEONARDO DA VINCI has not better expressed their effects, than PLATO in his Dialogue of the Sophist, and SOCRATES in the tenth book of his Republic.

The im¬ mense height and beautiful form of that part tovards the north, which is still remaining, produces the former; and the deplorable con¬ dition of the side towards the south occasions the latter. It would be superfluous in me to undertake to inform you, how often this build¬ ing has been exposed to the fury of Goths and Vandals. But I may venture to mention one piece of history of later date, that the barbarism of those rude people never arrived to that of Christians: for they carried off onely the pieces of iron, and other metal, about this building; but these the very stones themselves: so that it has been very justly said, Quod non faciebant BARBARI, fecerunt BARBERINI. Al¬ most all the stones of the south-side of this building have been taken away; and were em¬ ployed in building the Farnese palace, and the Cancellaria, both exceeding large edifices. This amphitheatre has been described and drawn so often, that it would be needless to enter into any description of it: I shall therefore onely make some sev observations upon some particu¬ lars, "
        ],
        [
            "LETTER LXVI. 277 lars, of which, I believe, no notice has been hitherto taken. The Coliseo or amphitheatre of TITUS had formerly eighty arches in its outward circuit, thirty six of which are now remaining, together with the whole superstructure on the north-side, tovards the Baths of TITUS. On the key¬ stones of these arches one sees numbers marked in large characters, from XXIII tO LIIII inclu¬ in large characters, from XXIII tO LIIII inclu¬ sive: but the arch betwixt XXXVIII and XXXVIIII is lest unmarked; which, upon examination, I found to be above sixteen feet wide, whereas the adjoining are not quite fourteen and an half. This therefore was one of the chief en¬ trances; and might probably be appropriated to the Emperor; and for that reason had no oc¬ casion to be numbered, being sufficiently distin¬ guished by some inscription, or ornament in basso relievo. This seems very probable from the present remains of the old walling or rough work over this arch; in which one may plainly per¬ ceive the impression lest of the marble, which contained some basso relievo, or inscription. And from the ruinous appearance of this place at present, one may judge, that this ornament, at present, one may judge, that this ornament, whatever it was, was fixed above the cornice of the lower order, and took up not only the base, the lower order, and took up not only the base, but part of the opening of the second order. And it is certain, that this ornament must have been "

Having thus fixed the principal entrance, Iimagined there might be another directly op¬ posite thereto, in the fhort diameter on the south-side. The outward circuit of the arches there is quite destroyed: but the middle arch of the fourth circuit within I found to be above fifteen foot and a half wide. So that allowing for the gradual diminution of the arches, from the out- side towards the arena, we may fairly the out- side towards the arena, we may fairly conclude the middle arch of the outer circuit, on that side, to have been likewise above six¬ teen feet. And here I observed, in the turn or cieling of the arch, some remains of rich mouldings in stucco, divided into square com¬ partiments, and adorned with figures in relief. So that this entrance ansvered exactly to that designed for the Emperor, where there are greater remains of these mouldings, adorned with figures in stucco; and where it may be observed, that not onely the middle arch was thus adorned, quite through from the outer circuit to the inner, but the next adjoining one on each side. And as this entrance, being more conspicuous by its ornaments, might be destined for "

Tho the arches of the outward circuit of the¬ long diameter of the ampitheatre be now gone; yet the middle arches of the third circuit, viz, one on the east-side towards the church of S. JOHN di Laterano, and the opposite on the west tovards the temple of Peace, immediately strike the eye with a great difference in propor¬ tion from the arches next adjoining, which are not above ten foot wide, whereas, the former are fifteen foot tyo inches. From whence one may conclude, that those of the outer circuit were near of the same dimension with those of the fhort diameter, viz. the entrances of the Emperor, and those of the Consuls, &c. The reason of this great difference of the arches at the long end of the amphitheatre, is the turn of the oval. For as the arches must necessarily at the oval. For as the arches must necessarily at that part lessen inwards, much more than any others, the nearer they approach the arena; the archi¬ the nearer they approach the arena; the archi¬ tect chose to throw all the diminution upon the next adjoining arches within, that the middle one, being designed for one of the chief en¬ trances, might be lest as free and open as pos¬ sible. I could distinguisi no rich mouldings, or ornaments, as at the- other two entrances, or ornaments, as at the- other two entrances, there being onely plain stucco, like the cielings of the rest of the arches: so that it is likely, of the rest of the arches: so that it is likely, that "

Thus, I imagine, it appears, tnat, of the fourscore arches in this wonderful structure, four were designed for the principal entrances; which being appropriated to particular uses, and sufficiently distinguished by their larger dimensions, &c. there was no occasion to num¬ ber them, like the other seventy six: upon all which it is probable numbers had been fixed, to allot them to the several districts of the city; that crowd and confusion might be avoided in entering, and the people when admitted might go directly to the places appointed for them; as the boxes are still numbered in all the Italian theatres. As there is non number upon the arch betwixt those tywo which are marked XXXVIII. and XXXVIIII. as observed above; this a cir¬ cumstance which makes it more probable, that the arch directly opposite (on the next arch to the arch directly opposite (on the next arch to which towards the right NO.

Lam informed, that Verona it is generally said, that the place of most honour in their amphitheatre, was at one of the extremities of the oval. But what has been before observed is an argument to the contrary; at least, that it was otherwise in the Roman amphitheatre. it was otherwise in the Roman amphitheatre. Because it is certain, that a seat in the mid¬ die of the fhort diameter must be much more convenient for view: for supposing the Emperor seated at one extremity of the long diameter, and beasts or gladiators fighting at the other, he would be at too great a distance the other, he would be at too great a distance to see distinctly; whereas no part of the arena was too far distant from the principal seats in the short diameter. Having said thus much upon the four chief entrances, which, in my opinion, are still plain¬ ly to be distinguished; I shall submit the de¬ cision of this matter to those more curious and learned, who may hereafter visit these wonderful remains of Roman magnificence.

The ancients generally made use of them, onely to adorn their houses and pub¬ use of them, onely to adorn their houses and pub¬ lic edifices. They attempted indeed some small pictures in this kind of work, wrought with some delicacy, but always imperfect, because they used onely natural stones: whereas now factitious stones are applied to the same pur¬ pose, to which all the colours may be given for which there is occasion. The ancient poets represent this city; with the places adjacent, as being the throne of the places adjacent, as being the throne of VENUS. To judge of the veneration the peo¬ ple payed to this goddess, one need onely cast ones eyes upon the lamps which have been found here. Those of earth are modest, except a small number, upon which are represented a small number, upon which are represented those indecent figures, which the ancients com¬ prehended under the generical word Spinctria.

But as to the brazen lamps, they are so many monuments of the assiduous worship which the Herculanians rendered to VENUS; and one may observe in their different forms all that is most fantastical, and at the same time most obscenè, which the most impure imagination could pos¬ sibly produce. A great number of medals have been found, of all sorts of models and metals; they are of all sorts of models and metals; they are either consular, or of the high empire, and have at least the merit of having been as well pre¬ served as one could desire. May we not flatter ourselves, that this ancient city will at last in¬ rich us with an OTHO in copper?

Those of NERO deserve but little attention, except one of grand copper: on one side is this Emperor’s head, with the legend, NERO. CLAVDIVS. CAESAR. AVG. GERM. P. M. TR. P. IMP.

Thus it is to be presumed, that the sitting figure represents NERO himself; holding in his hand the helm of the state; and that the figure standing is CERES or Plenty, submitting to the Emperors orders upon his opening of his trea¬ sures: this seems denoted by the attitude of his right hand, which points at that kind of coffer like a scrinium, which is seen at the feet of many consular statues.

But that on the reverse of this medal is exactly in the same form with the chariot in bas relief upon the same form with the chariot in bas relief upon one side of the triumphal arch, which was erect¬ ed to this Emperor after his death, by order of the Senate and people of Rome.

The superstition of the ancients consecrated all tables in general, not onely those appropria¬ ted to the worship of the Gods, but even those in houses for the use of the family. These were reputed sacred, because the Penates or house¬ hold Gods were placed upon them, in order to partake of the supper. These Gods, or Genii, presiding over the tables, MERCURY to whom they made a libation after supper, and HERCULES a frequent guest, were on that account called a frequent guest, were on that account called Epitrapetii.

Hence it was necessary, that these tables should be channeled. The Tuscans placed these tables in the chief temples of their cities, in which their Senate and assemblies of people used to beheld: from whom this custom passed to the Romans, who observed it so religioully, that there was no Curia without a sacred table in it. Thus DIO¬ XYSIUS Halicarnassensis, Lib. I. informs us, that TATIUS placed in all the Curiae tables conse¬ crated to JUNO Quiritiâ, which remained to his timè? and FESTUS mentions Curial tables, on which offerings were made to JUNO, who vas called Curis. Thos in all cities there were public places pe¬ culiarly appropriated for the meeting of the Senates, (and particularly one in Herculaneum, as appears from* an inscription in REINESIUS) vet it is confirmed by the consent of ancient au¬ thors, that they frequently met in temples.

On which account, in the Curia Hostilia, Pompeia, and Julia, which were profane places, temples were constituted by the Au¬ gurs, that just decrees, according to ancient custom, might be made there. From hence was introduced the custom of beginning these councils with supplications to the Gods; as appears from SUETONIUS in Augustus who made a law, * that every Senator, before he took his place, should offer his supplications with frankincense and wine, at the altar of that God, in whose temple the Senate was assembled.3 On which account, in the Curiae, whether they were joined to temples, or were part of them, there were always tables, on which the fa¬ thers might pour out wine; and lest it should flow down upon the ground, as would have happened if poured upon an altar, they had a moulding on all sides, and a small channel, a moulding on all sides, and a small channel, within which being confined, it might run down into a sacred vessel, and be preserved. Of this kind there is no doubt that this table of the Herculanians was; and that such a table T t 2 might * Quò autem lecti ptobatique et religiosiùs, et minore mo¬ lestiâ, senatoria munera fungerentur, fanxit, ut prius quàm consideret quisquam, thure ac mero supplicaret, apud aram ejus dei, in cujus templo coir etur.

The letters are to be read backward from right to lest, and those which compose the former, are MVS SIETATNEREH, which read according to the Roman way is HERENTATEIS SVM. The first word is a derivative from HPH, the Greek name of JUNO, as Senatus is from Sene, and signifies not onely the assembly of Senators, but the place where they assembled. And since the Herculanian Senate was probably held in a Curia adjoining to the temple of JUNO, or perhaps in the temple itself, where this table was found, the Hetruscans or Cam¬ panians might give either place the name of HERENTATVM, which was called by the Greeks HPAION, and by the Latins IVNONAL. So that HERENTATEIS SVM is the same with IvNo¬ NALIS SVM. The Tuscan diphthong EI is very common in inscriptions, and is resolved into I, as it fre¬ in inscriptions, and is resolved into I, as it fre¬ quently is by the Latins: hence in VARRO we frequently meet with Noneis, Sabineis, Tuscu¬ laneis, for Nonis, Sabinis, Tusculanis, &c.

The verb SVM is likevise Tuscan: for in the Eugubian Tables we find EST, ESTO, ESTE, ESTV, and very many compounds from thence. And it was very customary for inscriptions of this kind to run in the first person, as if the offering itself spoke; as EGO SVM ISIS, EGO SVM OSIRIS, I am ISIS, I am OSIRIS. Thus in the Sigean am ISIS, I am OSIRIS. Thus in the Sigean marble basis the offering says of itself, b ANO¬ AIKOT EIMI, PHANODICI SUM, I AM the gift of PHANODICUS, &c. In the other part of the inscription, placed on the edge, the first letter is L, and those that the edge, the first letter is L, and those that compose the next word IIBALS, which is SLABII: then follows another L. after which are LIHCVA, Or AVCHIL: all which make L.

So that the first four words are LUCIUS SALVIUS, LU¬ CIUS AQUILIUS. Next to these tyo names follows the office and dignity of each, SSIRREM and SKITCVT, and dignity of each, SSIRREM and SKITCVT, MERRISS and TVCTIKS: which plainly seem to set before us that consular dignity, of which LIVY speaks Lib.

This appellative is compound¬ ed of MEAQ, curo, impero, (from whence comes MEAQN Curator Rex) and ACTT, urbs. Hector gave his son the name of A¬ styanax, which signifies the defender of the city; and perhaps this word was known to the Per¬ sians, among whom we meet with Astyages. It was afterwards carried by the Greeks or Phry¬ gians into Italy, where a city was from thence called Astu. Mediastuticus therefore is the same as Curator urbis; which the Greeks, trans¬ posing the words, expressed by ATTTME AON. The Oscians who bordered upon the Cam¬ panians, (after whom the Etruscans and Pelas¬ gians, and at last the Samnitians were in posses¬ sion of Herculaneum,) made use of the first half of this word to denote their chief magistrate, whom they called MEDDIX: as is evident from ENNIUS in Annal. VIII. Summùs ubi capitur MEDDIX, occiditur alter which is confirmed likevise by Festus.

But the Herculanians, instead of MEDDIX in¬ scribed this table with MERRISS; which is per¬ haps to be attributed to their peculiar dialect, or to the derivation of the title of this office from another fountain, from METPQ sortiri, this office being perhaps conferred by lot. But be this as it will, it is certainly the name of a Duumvirate, who held the chief rank either in the Senate, or some tribe of the Herculanians. the Senate, or some tribe of the Herculanians. The following word, distinguished by an in¬ terpunction, being formed of the letters SKIT¬ CVT, is TVCTIKS, the ending of which is the same with that of MEDDIX, declines a little from its primaeval original ACTT, from whence the Campanians used astuticum for urbanum. The use of the aphaeresis was very frequent among the Etruscans, whoby taking away the two initial letters from Astutix, made it Tutix. Or per¬ haps this word might be derived from the old verb tueor, and signifie the same as Tuitor Custos Tribûs.

In the shorter title it IS HERENTATEIS in the genitive case, but here IS HERENTATEIS in the genitive case, but here it is put in the dative HERENTATE. Nor is the double sense of this word, men¬ tioned above, repugnant to this place: for it may denote either the Curia in which the Mediastutici dedicated this table, or that L. SLABIUS and L. AQUILIUS the Mediastutici, as Aediles, Cen¬ sors, and Keepers, or as Aeditui, dedicated it in that place. For the next word IANIKVRP or PRVKINAI is from IIPOKOINOT Rei¬ publicae Curator, Aedilis, or Quaestor: from IIPO, and KOINOΣ communis, and KOI¬ NOTHC communitas; from whence come the following compounded words, frequently used by the Greek writers Δημοκοινος, Minister or Servus publicus. Ἐπικοινος, communis, THoλυ¬ κοινος, multis communis. If we rather chuse to interpose a letter, PRVKINAI may very well be derived from IIPO KPINQ, ante alios con¬ stituo, or caeteris praepono, from KPINQ, se¬ cerno, eligo, dirimo; which word certainly passed from Greece into Italy, and gave the Latins their discrimen.

POMPONIUS FLAC¬ CUS being consuls, twelve cities in Asia minor were overturned and ruined in one night by an carth-quake, namely, Sardes, Magnesia, Phila¬ delphea, Tmolus, Cyme, Temnos, Myrina, Apollo¬ nidea, Hyrcania, Mostene, Aegaeae, Hierocaesarea.

To relieve these cities under this calamity, a decree of the Senate was passed, most probably by the Emperors influence, that they should be repaired and restored, and be exempted from be repaired and restored, and be exempted from paying any tribute for five years; and that a Colossean statue should be erected to the Em¬ a Colossean statue should be erected to the Em¬ peror, to perpetuate the memory of this bene¬ faction.

From whence it is evident, that the basis was not at that time finished, (nor perhaps begun) because Cibyra is represented upon it; and by the inscription it appears, that the Colossus was not erected till eight years afterwards. After which erection, it is highly probable, that those other coins, in memory of this benefaction, were struck, which take no notice of the year of the Tribunicial power. So that the year of this power, marked upon some of the coins, contributes little or nothing to the discovery of the particular vears, when these cities were destroyed, or shattered, by the earth-quakes: it shews onely the fact of re¬ the earth-quakes: it shews onely the fact of re¬ storing them, and the certain year when each of the "

The grief expressed here by these tyo figures above all the rest, was on the account of the great de¬ struction of people, besides the ruin of walls and buildings. The latter TIBERIUS could re¬ pair and rebuild: but he could not restore the husband to his wise, or the father to the son. This was sufficient cause for shedding abun¬ dance of tears, and finging the funeral song, called by the Romans NENIA; which was sung by boys, or women hired for that purpose, who were called PRAEFICAE, quasi in hoc ipsum praefectae.

The Sar¬ dians by this earth-quake lost not onely the build¬ ings of their city, but their parents, children, brothers, and dearest friends. This was cause sufficient why they should be represented here as singing the Nenia by a woman, when the rest of these cities are denoted each by a man, ex¬ cept Myrina and Mostene.

This Magnesia was near Sardis at the foot of mount Sipylus, and therefore called Mαyvygla ὑπὸ Σιτύλῳ: there was another Magnesia in Thessaly, and a third on the river Maeander. Under the third statue is the word PHILA¬ DELPHEA; which city is represented by a per¬ son in a long garment down to his ancles. This city was possessed sometimes by the My¬ sians, and sometimes by the Lydians, and on that account ascribed by some Geographers to Lydia, and by others to Mysia.

There are here at this time English and Scotch, Painters and Sculptors, to the number of sixteen; among whom there is so great a harmony, that we have formed an Academy among ourselves. It has been observed, that England produces as great geniuses in painting and sculpture, as any other countrey; but that, either through bad conduct, or want of due encouragement, they seldom come to perfection. This has given oc¬ casion to the students here of this and other na¬ tions, to entertain disadvantageous notions of the English, as if they were incapable of doing the English, as if they were incapable of doing any thing beyond a portrait; or that, if they were capable, it would be folly in them to ap¬ plie themselves to the nobler art of History¬ painting, which is so little esteemed and en¬ couraged in England.

What sig¬ nification then can that sea-shell have here? Why, as ὅστρεία ὅr ὅστρεα, ostrea, any sea-sish covered with shells, is a derivative ἀπὸ τοῦ ὁστράκου; and as ὄστρακον signifies the spell of a fisp, as well as an earthen-pot, potsherd, or the spell of a fisp, as well as an earthen-pot, potsherd, or tile, in Latin testa, and in Italian testaceo; the shell of such a sisi (the proper quality of shells being to cover) was much more proper to denote the Ostracism, than to have placed on the ground a fragment of a broken vase which could not have been so easily distinguished as a shell.

To make this particular description of the characters more intelligible, and to give the curious a perfect idea of them, it was thought necessary to represent the greater part of them on copper plates. The seven letters, which are of the same form with some Roman Capitals, there was no occasion to ingrave at all; nor to exhibit a double representation of the rest, which have very near the same shape, and differ chiesly in magnitude. It was therefore deemed sufficient to represent onely the smaller characters, which are upon the First Pillar, exactly ac¬ cording to their dimensions; and to take notice of those of the larger, which are upon the Second, in order to shew the difference. One of the larger it was thought proper to exhibit in its full magnitude, viz. † Chi, be¬ cause that letter is onely upon the Second Pillar, being not to be found among the smaller on the First.
