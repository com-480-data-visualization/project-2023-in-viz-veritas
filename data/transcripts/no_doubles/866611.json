In the following work I censure with great freedom the accounts given of Italy by several English and several foreign writers of travels.

Your know¬ ledge of its language and manners is hardly less than my own, who am a native of that country; and vour knowledge of its literature much more extensive. To you therefore, my Lord, as to a judge the best informed and the most candid, I beg leave to dedicate an essay intended to give your countrymen ideas of Italy something more correct than those which they have hitherto received from the writers on this subject.

THE folloving work was not under¬ taken solely with a design to animadvert upon the remarks of Mr. Sharp and those of other English writers, who after a short tour have ventured to describe Italy and the Italians. Much less would I pass it upon my reader for a complete and satis¬ factory account of that celebrated coun¬ try, taken in any one of those many points of view, under which it may be con¬ sidered. Thope no body will so much mistake the nature of my design. Thad long observed, with some indignation, that "

Thave there¬ fore taken occasion, especially from this book of Mr. Sharp, to make them sen¬ sible, if I can, of the errors they are led into, and to point out to them some ob¬ jects of inquiry more worthy of the curio¬ sity of sensible persons, and caution them against being too ready to condemn every thing but what they have seen practised at home. An indiscriminate admiration at home. An indiscriminate admiration of foreign manners and customs shows great folly; but an indiscriminate censure is both foolish and malignant. is both foolish and malignant. After having passed ten years in this kingdom, I returned to Italy in 1760. There I found that my brothers had col¬ lected into volumes all the letters 1 had wrote to them in that long space of time.

            "AN ACCOUNT O F O F I T A LI. CHAP. I. FEW books are so acceptable to the greatest part of mankind, as those that abound in slander and invective. Hence almost all accounts of travels, publisned within my memory, have quickly circu¬ lated, and were perused, at least for a while; with great eagerness, because they have been strongly marked with these characters. Men are fond of the mar¬ vellous in manners and customs as well as in events; and a writer of travels, who would make himself fashionable in his own country, is generally politic enough I 2 to "

        [
            "I 2 to bring from abroad abundant materials for gratifying, at once, the malignity and the love of novelty, that must predomi¬ nate in so many of his readers; and he who is so little conversant in the affairs of his own country, as not to have any of his speculations upon domestic affairs pro¬ duced without ridicule, may with safety, and sometimes with reputation, be very wise in those of other countries. An author of this cast, after a slight survey of the provinces, through which he has had occasion to take a short ramble, returns home; and snatching up his pen in the rage of reformation, fills pages and pages with scurrilous narratives of pretended absurdities, intermixed with the most shocking tales of fancied crimes; very gravely insisting, that those crimes and absurdities were not single actions of this and that individual, but general pic¬ tures of nature in the countries through which he has travelled. Every unexpe¬ rienced reader will infallibly be pleased with an opportunity of laughing at the prodigious "

            "I 3) prodigious folly of him who lives on the other side of the sea, and will always be glad to find that he may bless himself for not having been born in the wicked coun¬ try beyond the mountain. Thus falshood is palmed for truth upon the credulous, and thus are men confirmed in a narrow way of thinking, and in those local pre¬ judices, of which it ought to be the great end of travelling, and books of travels, to cure them. An itinerary lately publisned by Mr. Samuel Sharp on the customs and man¬ ners of Italy, seems to me above all others a book of this kind. Whether it is to be considered as a candid and instructive account of a foreign country, or as the offspring of an ignorant, care¬ or as the offspring of an ignorant, care¬ less, and prejudiced writer, will be occa¬ sionally examined in the following sheets: and should I prove earnest in the defence of my country, of which he has given of my country, of which he has given so very extraordinary an account, I hope I shall be excused by the generous sym¬ B 2 pathy "
        ],
        [
            "[ 4) pathy of all Englisimen, who are so laudably partial to their own. But before Tenter into the examen of Mr. Sharps book, it may not be amiss to prove, that he was totally unfit for to prove, that he was totally unfit for the task he has voluntarily undertaken; the difficult task of delineating the na¬ the difficult task of delineating the na¬ tion that inhabits the peninsula in which I was born, as he laid under three most capital disadvantages when he entered it; that is to say, he was ignorant of the Italian language; was of no high rank; and was afflicted with bodily disorders. That Mr. Sharp was ignorant of the Italian language, may be easily proved by only observing, that throughout his work he has spelt several names of fami¬ lies, of saints, and of towns erroneously. His inability in catching sounds when orally uttered, appears most glaringly in his miserable remarks on the Venetian dialect; a dialect very harsh and displeas¬ ing to his ears, and vet extremely smooth in itself, as it abounds in vowels even in itself, as it abounds in vowels even more than the Tuscan, which renders it delightful "
        ],
        [
            "I 5) delightful to the ears of all the Italians. Comparing this dialect with the Tuscan, Mr. Sharp affirms, that the Venetians have the words Dudice, Dulio, Diovenne, Maniare, and Ratone; but these words, which he writes dovn all in a string, he has whimsically coined himself, and not one of the five belongs to the Venetian dialect, or to any other dialect of Italy. Let any of my readers ask a Venetian, or any other Italian now in England, and I will venture to be called a calumniator, if any Italian whatsoever knows any of any Italian whatsoever knows any of these five words, either by Mr. Sharps spelling, or by any pronunciation that he may invent for them. Intending to throw a ridicule on the Italians, Mr. Sharp says, that they give the name of palaces even to their country the name of palaces even to their country houses. But he is himself ridiculous in saying so. Un palazzo means in Italian the building wbere the sovereign resides, or the house in which a nobleman lives. Thus Marlborough-house or Devonshire-house would, in Italian, be distinguished from B 3 common "
        ],
        [
            "I 6 common houses, and be called palazzos. What in England is a private mans habi¬ tation, or a building in wbich many common families live, in Italian is called una casa. The least knowledge of our language had shown Mr. Sharp the distinguishing pro¬ priety of these two words, and had kept him from stealing this blunder, along with many others, from Missons travels through Italy. Misson was not able to separate the idea annexed by the English to their word palace, from that annexed by the Italians to their word palazzo. He thought they both excluded littleness, which our word palazzo does not, and betrayed his unskilfulness in our language many years ago, as Mr. Sharp does now Mr. Sharp is likewise wrong in his assertion, that wbat in England is called a little crash of music, composed of tuo or three instruments, is, in Italian, called ACCA¬ DEMIA; and, that a trifling halfpenny errand is called AMBASCIATA. He has probably overheard some footman make use of these two words in these impro¬ per "

            "I 7 per senses, and acquainted his nation with the strange use that the pompous Italians make of their words: but foot¬ men will often speak as improperly in Italy as any where else; and instead of consulting such people about the mean¬ ing of words, he ought to have Iooked into a dictionary. I could say much more to prove by his book, that Mr. Sharp understands near as much Italian as many French barbers understand English after a monthes resi¬ dence in London. Lcould easily point out the meagerness of his remarks on the gutturality of the Florentine and the Sie¬ nese, and laugh at his acuteness in having discovered that they pronounce and ci as the English do che and chi. I could set in a strong light the impertinence of his in a strong light the impertinence of his decision as to the place where the best Italian is to be learned. But how is it possible for me to descend so very low, as to animadvert on the Italian language with this rare linguist, who talks through one fourth of his book of Cicispeos, and B 4 never "
        ],
        [
            "8 never once spells the word right, writ¬ ing for ever Cicesbeòs or Cecespeos? If his utter ignorance of the Italian language ought to have awed him into silence about the customs and manners of¬ Italy, the mediocrity of his rank in life could certainly not contribute much to¬ wards qualifying him for such an under¬ taking. I will not say by this, that it is an ab¬ solute requisite towards painting nations, to be a man of high rank; and Iam far from intending the least disparagement to him, when I say that he is not a man of high rank. I respect his profession; of high rank. I respect his profession; and if he had given me leave, T would respect himself. I mean only to say, that his descriptions of the manners of the Italian nobility, which fill up a consi¬ derable part of his work, are little to be credited, because his rank in lise, which in other respects was no disparagement and could be of no prejudice to him, kept the English ministers, as well as the noble the English ministers, as well as the noble Englisn travellers in Italy, from intro¬ . ducing "
        ],
        [
            "9 ducing him to the Italian nobles, and consequently from affording him an op¬ portunity of being properly acquainted with their true character. I must even go a step further, and af¬ firm, that in Venice Mr. Sharp never entered any nobleman’s house as a visitor, though he talks so much and so wisely about them and their domestic manners, I take it for granted, that Mr. Sharp is incapable of telling a deliberate un¬ truth when called upon: therefore I am sure this my assertion will pass without the least contradiction on his side; and I am likewise sure, in spight of his many let¬ ters from Rome and from Naples, in which he speaks so diffusely about the manners of the Roman and Neapolitan nobility, that he will never venture to say he ever entered as a visitor any Neapolitan or Roman house, except that of the mar¬ chioness Ceva at Rome, who, upon the simple recommendation of her hair-dresser, treated him with much kindness, and pro¬ cured "

            "I 10) cured him the means of seeing conve¬ niently the ceremonies of the holy week. But if Mr. Sharp went to Italy with¬ out any thing in his rank which could obtain him admittance into any noble¬ mans house, why did he not, at least, speak with some diffidence in their dis¬ paragement, and why did he advance with such an easy confidence, many things to which he neither was, nor could, be an eye-witness? How could he be so decisive in his calumnies on their domestic con¬ duct, and paint them all as the most vi¬ cious set of wretches that ever existed? Ought he not at least to have informed his readers, that whatever he related of them was a mere hearsay? Would an Italian surgeon, perfectly ignorant of the Englisn language, be intitled to any cre¬ dit, if, after a few months residence in England, he took into his head to give, in a printed book, the character of the a printed book, the character of the Englisi nobility, or even of the English coblers?

Tknovw that such a task is very difficult to a foreigner; and that, even after a long study of any people, we are liable to mistakes. I should, therefore, seel the greatest diffidence, and think myself obliged to speak with the greatest cau¬ tion, if ever I could prevail upon myself to make such an attempt, especially where Tfound myself disposed to condemn any general or reigning custom, to censure a whole sex, a whole profession, or any in¬ whole sex, a whole profession, or any in¬ tire body of people. Mr. Sharp observed, that the Italian nobles do not easily admit to their fami¬ liarity those foreigners who are not deco¬ rated by some great name or title; and because he was not treated with the re¬ gard that his personal merit claims from the nobility of his own country, he gave vent "
        ],
        [

But was it their fault, if they were not apprised of his great personal merit? Was it their fault if he was not in¬ troduced to any of them? As to his third disqualification, it is not difficult to comprehend, that a man in a bad state of health is very unfit to make observations on nations, and de¬ scribe their manners from his own know¬ ledge. Mr. Sharp went to Italy with a painful asthma that often threatened his lise, and once forced him to keep his bed for near tvo months at Naples: therefore, when ever he reached any town, he stayed at home, and scarcely ever conversed with any native or stranger. Tam positive he will not deny, that, in Venice especially, he seldom visited the English resident he seldom visited the English resident there, though he makes so free with his name, as to relate a story of him, which I apprehend cannot be true, as I shall prove in "

            "I 13 J in due time. But the man who will play the censor upon nations, must give me leave to tell him, that he has need of some other qualifications besides that of a trou¬ blesome malady. Together with a good share of understanding, this hard task re¬ quires some personal activity, to be able to introduce ones self every where with ease and propriety, and take every where a close view of the privacies of the high, a close view of the privacies of the high, the middling, and the low. A diseased the middling, and the low. A diseased body seldom cloathes a chearful mind; and the man not enlivened by chearful¬ ness will seldom get admittance to those privacies; or, if admitted, will seldom see objects as they are. His sadness will diffuse itself over every thing he looks on, and all objects will be misrepresented by moroseness and ill-nature, the ordinary, concomitants of bad health. Hence Mr. SharpS asperity and rancour whenever he speaks of what he saw or heard in Italy, where he could not possibly find any ho¬ nest or knowing man but himself, nor any modest and elegant lady, but those really deserving "

        [

We are therefore not to wonder if a man thus ignorant of the language, of a rank not imposing with regard to the Italians, and afflicted with a dangerous disorder, has not been able to tell many truths, and has caricatured many facts: but we have real reason for surprise, to see him, under these disadvantages, setting confidently about such a work as that of describing a large nation, or rather a cluster of little nations, which differ among themselves not only in manners and in customs, but in government and in laws, and even in dress and in lan¬ in laws, and even in dress and in lan¬ guage. We have reason for surprise to hear him talk with the greatest assurance about a country, which he only visited in a cursory manner, stopping only a few in a cursory manner, stopping only a few days, and often only a sew hours, in the greatest part of its cities.

A daring genius indeed! Yet let me give in the next chapter a small specimen of his strange method of fur¬ nishing himself with the necessary mate¬ rials for his travelling letters, and let me tell a fhort tale of him, the genuineness of which he will certainly not venture to deny. CHAP. II. ONE Signor Giuseppe Baretti (myself Imean) went from Venice to Ancona in the year 1765. I had been there about three months without ever having had the pleasure of seeing an English traveller go through or by the place; when lo! on a morning betimes, one Signor Cecco Storani came to "

            "I 16 to me in a hurry, and told me, that latè to me in a hurry, and told me, that latè the preceding night an English gentleman with thre young ladies had put up at the Post-house; and as he did not under¬ stand English, he desired I would intro¬ duce him to these strangers, that he and his family might show them fome civili¬ ties. This Signor Cecco is the son of an Anconitan nobleman, decorated by the pope or the pretender (no matter which) with the title of English consul in that town. The British consulship there is certainly not very profitable in point of interest: but the nobility of Ancona Iook upon it as very honourable, and they are fond of it, as it gives them some con¬ sideration in the place, besides affording them an opportunity of being liberal of their dinners to many strangers, and espe¬ cially the English, of whom they are enamoured to a degree of enthusiasm. If Mr. Sharp knew me personally, he would certainly do me the honour to be¬ lieve me, when I aver that 1 was much pleased "
        ],
        [
            "I 17 pleased with this piece of intelligence from Signor Cecco. NOW, said I, I shall see an Englishman again; and what is still infinitely better, some English wo¬ men, whose conversation will renew those pleasing ideas, of which 1 have been so long deprived. But alas, what a disap¬ pointment! Though it was scarcely eight o'clock, as far as I can remember, on my reaching the inn with my friend, I found that the gentleman and the ladies were gone. They had got an hour be¬ fore into their coach, and were hast¬ ing towards Loretto, in their way to Rome. I No man in his senses can suppose that a gentleman who travels with such pre¬ a gentleman who travels with such pre¬ cipitancy along the Romagna and the Marca, is a fit person to meddle with the business of describing the manners the business of describing the manners and customs of their inhabitants. Yet Mr. Sharp has boldly meddled with that business, for the gentleman who travelled with those young ladies, was Mr. Sharp himself. On "

        [
            "18 On his arrival at Loretto the same evening of that day in which he lest An¬ cona, Mr. Sharp sat gravely down to write a long letter to an imaginary cor¬ respondent in England, and informed him of the disadvantages that Ancona lies under, from the infinite concessions made to the church by the commercial and military parts of the nation. A fine period, and in the true po¬ litical style! But did Mr. Sharp under¬ stand it himself when he had written it? For my part 1 do not, as I never heard at Ancona of any commercial or mi¬ litary parts of the Anconitan nation. The church at Ancona is the absolute tem¬ poral sovereign as well as the spiritual: and what concessions do absolute sovereigns want from any part of their subjects? It is true, that there are at Ancona many commercial people; that is, some dozen of merchants: and itis true there are some military people; that is, about two score of soldiers: but neither of these two of soldiers: but neither of these two parts of that nation do, or can, constitute any distinct political body endowed with any "

Yet these concessions are infinite by his account. After this woeful affair of the infinite concessions, Mr. Sharp adds, that Ancona has a sine citadel and a mole. Yet, what¬ ever beauty he may have discovered in a citadel which he did not visit, and of which he only saw some outward part, as he was coming along shore from Fiu¬ as he was coming along shore from Fiu¬ micino, I will make bold to tell this skil¬ ful engineer, that the citadel of Ancona is not very fine, if the beauty of a citadel consists in the strength of its walls and the regularity of its parts. Then his skimming lightly on Ancona’s mole, and coupling it with the citadel, make me suppose, that he heard somebody at the inn mention such a thing as a mole; and so he set the word down in his memoran¬ dum-book, that he might not forget to clap it in the letter which he was to write about Ancona that same evening, or C 2 "

It is a wall, if 1 may so call it, built in the a wall, if 1 may so call it, built in the sea, in order to check the impetuosity of the waves, which render that port very unsafe whenever the wind blows from the¬ opposite coast of the Adriatic. As that wind blows very frequently in summer, and almost perpetually in winter, the late Pope began this work, after having de¬ clared Ancona frec port. They began upon the small remains of an ancient Ro¬ man mole. The present work is to be about two thousand feet in length, if not more; and vwhen Mr. Sharp passed that way, there was already twelve hundred feet of it finished. Its breadth is one hundred feet, and its depth sixty-eight from the water’s edge. Many ships load¬ ed with that kind of sand called Pozzolana, ed with that kind of sand called Pozzolana, go to Ancona every year from the neighbourhood of Rome, where it is found, and no other sand is admitted in the "

The stone at first came also by sea from that part of Istria which belongs to the Ve¬ netians: but the Venetians, not being willing to permit large exportations of that material for the carrying on a work which was to be detrimental to them in a commercial view, made the Roman go¬ vernment think of other means to provide stone for continuing the mole. A Ro¬ man architect, called Marchionne, who has the direction of the work, searched carefully the hills about Ancona, and dis¬ covered a quarry of very hard stone, not unlike marble; and by means of his dis¬ covery the Anconitans were luckily freed from the necessity of providing themselves with that material from Istria. Accord¬ ing to the plan of the architect Vanvitelli, pursued by his able successor Marchionne, this mole is to be very broad at the end, and to have a fortress on it, with a light¬ house. It is adorned with two triumphal arches, one ancient, the other modern. The C 3 "

But he is very wrong when he la¬ ments so woefully his hard fate, that led him through these two provinces.

But how could Mr. Sharp be so simple as to strike such a bargain, and submit voluntarily to go near three hundred miles through such a sandy, rocky, and hilly country with the same cattle? Did he not conceive that by such a bargain he made it the interest of that a bargain he made it the interest of that fellow to take him to the cheapest inns, which is as much as to say the most beg¬ garly, that the feeding of his fare might cost him little?

But when he did speak of that place, it was proper that he should that place, it was proper that he should know something of it. But he saw little, inquired less, and reflected not at all; blindly following his travelling predeces¬ sors in their invectives against the pope government.

That government made it a free port, by which they gave up some revenue: they were at they gave up some revenue: they were at the expence of a new Lazzaretto, the most magnificent building of the kind in Europe; and they have been many vears carrying on that expensive work of the mole, to which the revenues of the whole province are appropriated. These are facts; and Mr. Sharps observations are nothing but Ioose talk and common-place declamation.

On my first arrival at Ancona Iwas not a little surprized to re¬ ceive some presente of fish, game, oranges, and fruits from several of its wretched inhabitants, that is, from some of their best people.

This 1 thought a pretty piece of urba¬ nity; and this what many people of Ancona do to every stranger who stops any time there.

As he was going to alight at the inn there, he could not help seeing many houses, and even whole streets, built anew; and his wonderous sagacity led him imme¬ diately to conclude, that Sinigaglia was a rising town; which I grant: but not for the reason he assigns, as the fair he men¬ the reason he assigns, as the fair he men¬ tions, instead of annually improving, 1s annually decaying. Sinigaglia oves its ris¬ ing to its own small port, which having been made better within these sew years, enables its inhabitants to carry on a little trade the whole year round. Besides, their being so near the much-improved port of Ancona is likewise of some advantage to them, as they can send thither their wheat, turkey-corn, hemp, and filk, of which their territory produces much, and ship these and other commodities for dif¬ tant markets. But it is not true, that Sinigaglia "
        ],
        [
            "(32) Sinigaglia is the only rising town in Italy; and it may easily be proved that this pe¬ remptory assertion is quite impertinent, as there are many other towns in Italy that have risen within these sew years, and rise actually much faster in proportion than Sinigaglia. Amongst these, I will only name Turin, Florence, Leghorn and Naples. Turin is become a full fourth more populous, since the addition of some provinces, made a sew years ago, to the king of Sardinias dominions. Florence and Leghorn encrease both in buildings and inhabitants since their sovereign re¬ sides no more at Vienna; and Naples be¬ gins to be too monstrous a capital for that kingdom, since it is no more governed by viceroys. If Mr. Sharp had taken the least inspection of Ancona, he would have been convinced that it rises likewise much faster than Sinigaglia. Thave had an opportunity of examining the entries of the smips at their custom-house, and have sound, that about twenty years ago the Anconitans could scarcely see twenty merchant¬ 3 "

Their en¬ crease of commerce has already enriched many of their families, and, among others, that of the marquis Trionfi, (or Francis Trionfi, as his correspondents call him) who by a trade skilfully managed, has ac¬ quired in a little time such a fortune, as would enable him to make a figure even on the Change of London. If at Sinigaglia they have built much of late, they have built much more at Ancona, where the noblemen do not scruple to be¬ come merchants. The marquis Trionfi alone has built himself such a dwelling¬ house in Ancona, and so many houses be¬ house in Ancona, and so many houses be¬ sides in various parts of the territory, that the whole together would almost form a the whole together would almost form a Sinigaglia. Of these two towns Mr. Sharp took but a hasty view, as he was going along in his coach, and then said rashly what came uppermost. He talked of the rising of the one, and of the ex¬ of the rising of the one, and of the ex¬ treme wretchedness of the other, without D knowing "

However though Mr. Sharp is some¬ times mistaken in his object, 1 will do him the justice of saying, that upon the whole he appears to be a good-natured man; and of a country too, where good¬ nature is so utterly engrossed, that many Englishmen think it even impossible to find an equivalent for the word itself in any other language. Mr. Sharps immense tenderness shows itself upon almost every occasion. He is drooping with sadness when he crosses any desart spot, and re¬ volves in his mind, that formerly that self same spot was famous for its fertility and populousness. He feels great compassion in surveying the bellies of the fat priests, in surveying the bellies of the fat priests, and the thin guts of the people; and is and the thin guts of the people; and is ready to weep at both from opposite mo¬ tives: he drops a tear when he considers how ignorant, helpless, and wretched the Italians are; and gives vent to many deep sighs as he is reverendly kneeling on great Galileo S "

Had he forgot that those pirates are a gang of Mahometans and Jews, of the verv of Mahometans and Jews, of the verv worst kind, to say nothing of Renegados? It is true, that the Loretto-people are Christians of the very worst kind, in Mr. Sharpis opinion: yet one would think, that a good-natured man, and one of the best kind of Christians, could never be pleased to hear of any goods, whether wisely or superstitiously employed, be¬ longing to Christians of any denomina¬ tion, carried away to Algiers or Tripoli, to promote the happiness of infidelity and the triumph of unbelievers.

Any other Christian, less stimulated by good-nature than Mr. Sharp, would have acted quite differently in his case; and after having taken, from within his coach, so exact a survey of the Adriatic as Mr. Sharp did, he would, on his ar¬ rival at Rome, have gone straight to the Pope, and, without mincing the matter, would have told his holiness of the great ease with which the Barbary-pirates could land in that part of his holinesss domi¬ nions, "

Whatever the sagacity of Mr. Sharp may be on this point, he was not, how¬ ever, the first who took notice of the great facility with which Loretto might be plundered. Many protestant travel¬ lers, full as good-natured and sagacious as him, have spoke of it long before he visited Italy; and the great Addison him¬ self would have the honour of being one of them. Addison says, that such an enterprise might prove difficult to the Turks, because the Venetians keep too watchful an eye over their motions; but would be an easy thing for a Christian prince, wbo had spips pas¬ sing too and fro, without suspicion, especially D 3 ij "

Such are the wise observations the greatest wits are apt to make on their travels, when they inspect countries from their post-chaises, and are otherwise pre¬ judiced against the places they visit. But if Addison had examined Loretto and the adjacent parts ever so superficially, he would not have exposed himself to the ridicule of those Roman catholics who know something of the matter. Loretto is a small town, tolerably for¬ tified, that lies on an eminence, near three miles from the sea. The several paths from Loretto the sea-side, far from being flat and smooth, are all so winding and craggy, that a man needs Iook how he walks, if he has no mind to dislocate he walks, if he has no mind to dislocate his collar-bone. Between the town and the sea, all along the coast, there are the sea, all along the coast, there are many country-houses, and many cottages many country-houses, and many cottages of peasants and fishermen; and within an hour’s walk of Loretto, on three different sides, 2 "

A ship is made ready in some distant port, and is made ready in some distant port, and manned with a numerous, brave and faith¬ sul Christian crew. The Argosy sails away, and in so secret a manner, that no soul is apprised of its destination but ita captain. This captain steers tovards Loretto, and skilfully pitches upon a dark night to anchor opposite the tovn, that he may to anchor opposite the tovn, that he may not be discovered by the several guards that watch the coast, or seen by the nu¬ merous fishing-boats that svarm there every D 4 "

CHAP. IV.

The Venetian common people are all apprised of his resolution; and that nò Englishman has been murdered he ascribes to this measure. HOW Mr. Sharp could venture to tell such a story T cannot possibly conceive. I have had the honour of being, for a long while, very intimately acquainted with that English resident in Venice; I have a thousand times talked with him 3 about "
        ],
        [
            "I about the chearful nature of the common people there, of whom he had certainly no bad opinion, and to whom, instead of being terrible, as Mr. Sharp would insi¬ nuate, he had so endeared himself with his affability, that, as he was walking about, they would often stop and bless him loudly. Caro quel muso; ciera de im¬ perador: siestu benedeto: benedeta quela to panza, and other such hearty and comi¬ cal expressions he was regaled with, and many times a day; which probably had not been the case, had he threatened them, upon his arrival, by any loud pro¬  clamation. A proclamation, if 1 understand it right, is a public notice given by means of a crier. But did the English resident give notice by means of a crier, that he would bring to punishment any Venetian who should assassinate an Englishman? No certainly; because foreign ministers have no such right in the countries where they are sent to reside, and are, under no pretence, allowed to threaten the "

No, certanly; because murder is punished with death in Venice as well as any where else; and a bare surmise that it was not, had been highly offensive and intolerably injurious to the Venetian go¬ vernment.

His reflections on the Italian government imply such atrocious accusations, that he ought to have taken more care to prove his assertions. It is, for instance, a gross misrepresentation his saying, that the church throughout Italy shelters murderers and assassins.

But to point out every place, in which the church is, or is not, a sanctu¬ ary, and to note down all the different kinds of crimes for which the church (where it is a sanctuary) allows or denies a shelter, would be too prolix a detail in a shelter, would be too prolix a detail in the great variety of Italian governments.

Sobriety and love of labbur make the peasants of Tuscany live in the manner Mr. Sharp saw them live; (if it is true that he has minded them) and if many of the Ge¬ noese peasants inhabit houses that are often mistaken for gentlemen’s habita¬ tions, it is to be attributed to a degree of both these qualites in them, which is almost incredible.

But since Mr. Sharp has brought me on the banks of Arno, I beg of him to let me take no¬ tice, that his account of Tuscany does not quite agree with that of bishop Burnet. Burnet says, that as one goes over Tuscany, it appears, so dispeopled, that one cannot but wonder to find a country that has been a scene of so much action and so many wars, now so forsaken and so poor, that in many places the soil is quite neglected for want of hands to cultivate it; and in other places, wbere there are more people, they look so poor, and their houses are such miserable ruins, that it is scarce accountable how there spould be so much poverty in so rich à coun¬ try, wbich is all full of beggars.

The assembling and directing a troop of those officers cannot often be done in a moment; and in the mean time a criminal hastens away in the mean time a criminal hastens away towards a neighbouring state. It is true that the Italian sovereigns reciprocally give up their criminals to each other, if they are caught; and count Nogarola, who had made his escape into Piedmont, after having committed a murder in Ve¬ rona, was arrested near Turin, and sent to the Venetians, who put him to death, to the Venetians, who put him to death, as I said already.

Had Mr. Sharp been able to make such reflections, he would certainly have been aware, that the character of a nu¬ merous nation does not depend on a fev individuals scattered about half a dozen large towns; but that it depends on the many millions contained in two or three hundred small ones, and in their terri¬ tories.

It is not in the power of a sew ages to change utterly those general customs that have been long settled, or subvert the universal manners of large nations. The Muscovites are forced by a law to be very polite at Petersburgh and Moscow where the gentlemen cut their beards, and the ladies paint.

The Italians know how to make a difference between an ordinary woman a difference between an ordinary woman and a polite lady, to whom they surrender their hearts. The one is a mere woman, who may remind them of the common calls of nature: but the other is a sub¬ lime being; a divine sovereign of the thoughts; an object of the greatest reve¬ rence, never to be approached but as an angel clad in human form.

And it is not long since a most grave man, who is both a physician and a knight, reminded me of the effeminacy of Capua, which was the destruction of the great Hanni¬ bal and his valiant soldiers; and vet those same soldiers were born and bred in the warmest climates of Africa.

Would then Gabrieli be more liberally paid if sne was engaged for the Hay¬ market? There she would scarcely be paid more than a thousand pounds, and be at the expence of coming and going, besides the greater expence that she would be put to for living, which is, at least, thrice dearer in London than in Naples. Mr. Sharp seems firmly persuaded, that the Italian muficians get vast heaps of guineas here, and buy large estates with English money when they go back to their homes: but let him, if he can, name more than one Italian finger who ever grew rich in England since Senesino.

Were the Spectator translated ever so well into Arabic, it would please the Arabs still less than it does the French.

And was any man to model his opinions on Voltaires assertion with regard to the French writers, the king of Prussia himself would smile at his credulity.

Such is the panegyric made by Mon¬ sieur de Voltaire on our Goldoni, both in prose and verse, in good French and in wretched Italian: and exactly at the same time when Mr. Sharp was in Venice, a vehement paper-war was carried on by the Italians on account of Goldoni, and on the praises lavished on him by that on the praises lavished on him by that famous Frenchman. Had Mr. Sharp. 1 when in that town, only stept into a bookseller’s shop or a coffee-house, and made the least enquiry about theatrical matters, it had been impossible for him not to hear of that paper-war.

Our stock of books on all sorts of subjects is so ample at this day, that learned and ingenious men can¬ not now have that facility which our pre¬ decessors had, of making themselves known to their contemporaries, and recommending O 3 "

AFTER the above slight account of cur literature, it may not be improper to speak of the advantages which the Italians may reasonably expect from addicting themselves to a studious lise. An infor¬ mation of this kind will lead my English readers into such parts of our customs, as no traveller of their nation, so far as I have observed, has vet taken notice. In Italy when a young man is trained up to physic, he has it in his power to get his livelihood by it in a very short time, if he vill apply to it in such a man¬ ner as to acquire any reputation. On his quitting the university, which is generally done after seven years, and after having taken all his degrees, he goes to serve as a volunteer in some great hospital, or puts himself "
        ],
        [
            "  J 220 himself to a kind of apprentisnip with one of the most noted physicians in a capital town, that he may now learn the practice, as he is supposed to have already learned the theory of physic. The phy¬ ficians of Italy visit all their patients with their young pupils constantly at their heels, oblige them to inspect minutely all the maladies that fall in their way, and the maladies that fall in their way, and take notice of the remedies they pre¬ scribe. This kind of lise a young beginner generally follows, until an opportunity offers to be chosen physician to an hos¬ pital, or to go in the same capacity to some small toyn or village, which is called andare in condotta. As soon as he hears of a vacancy in any provincial place that will suit his circumstances, he applies either personally or by letter to the cor¬ poration of it, offers his service, and pro¬ duces his certificates of having had his degrees, served his apprentiship, and lived as every honest man ought to live. On "
        ],
        [
            "221 On occasion of vacancies there are ge¬ nerally several competitors who strive to fill the empty place. But the young phy¬ fician who has acquired the best character both for skill in his profession, and pru¬ dence in common lise, has the best chance of succeeding in his application, and of being preferred to the other candidates. His success however depends on the suf¬ frages of the corporation; and the largest number of them is not always obtained by superior merit. Partiality and chance will sometimes interfere, and give a place to one that ought to have been given to another. But we are very sure, on the other hand, that officiousness avails but little in cases of such elections, and that places will never be procured by money, as we are still perfect strangers to the noble arts of bribing voters. When the place is once obtained, the voung physician keeps it until he hears of a better; and then he offers himfelf a of a better; and then he offers himfelf a candidate for that. By these means our provincial "
        ],
        [
            "(222 provincial physicians shist from place to place, that is, from a small condotta to a greater. No patient in any provincial place is obliged to fee his physician for his atten¬ dance, as each corporation allovs him a yearly salary. However almost all fami¬ lies, whether they have occasion for him or not, send him some little present at easter and at christmas, which consists of a Iamb or a kid, of hams, sausages, ca¬ a Iamb or a kid, of hams, sausages, ca¬ pons, game, oil, wine, corn, or the like. The poorest peasant would be ashamed not to send at least a couple of fowis to his physician on the holidays. This necessity of pushing themselves forward by mere dint of personal merit, and the liberty that people have of em¬ ploving any physician in the neighbour¬ hood, if they have no good opinion of their own, naturally creates much emu¬ lation amongst neighbouring physicians, and makes the greatest part of them apply very serioussy to their business; so that it is "
        ],
        [
            "223 is not rare to find some of them very skil¬ ful in their profession even in the ob¬ scurest towns of Italy; and Iwas much surprised two years ago in a petty village of the Upper Montferrat, called Rivalta, to find one signor Bovio, a young physi¬ cian, not only very skilful in the science of healing, but also possessed of a large of healing, but also possessed of a large collection of the natural productions of that province made by himself, and espe¬ cially of petrifications scarce to be found even in the amplest museums. Itis to that emulation we chiefly owe the works of cur BorelliS, Bellinis, Malpighis, BagliviS, Torricellis, Redis, and many others, whose names are known to the physicians of this part of the world, as well as those of Sydenham and Boerhaave. If a village happens to be so small as not afford a sufficient salary, it is annexed to one, two, or more of the neighbour¬ ing; and their common physician in such a case is enabled by them to keep a horse, a mule, or a vehicle. It is like¬ wise "

        [
            "224 wise the business of the corporation to provide a lodging for him whenever he is obliged to make any stay amongst them, and be absent a while from his usual place of residence. If the place, on the con¬ trary, is too large for one physician, the corporation has more than one salary to appoint, and more than one condotta to dispose of. The salaries, together with the regular presents, in many villages and provincial towns that 1 have visited, and where I have often made it a point to be particu¬ larly inquisitive on this head, are equi¬ valent, upon a medium, to a capitation of two shillings; and sew are the con¬ dotta’s that contain less than three hundred souls, as sew are likewise those that go beyond seven or eight hundred. So that our provincial physicians in the smallest places get about thirty or forty pounds a year, and seventy or eighty in the largest; which are sufficient competencies, as there is no provincial place throughout Italy, where a middling "

        [

Some of them remain for many years in their apprentiships; act as substi¬ tutes to their principals; get patients for themselves when they think it time to venture ontheir own bottoms, and set up in capital towns, where some of them have got very desirable fortunes. Whether this method of proceeding with regard to the practice of physic be preferable to that used in England I will not venture to determine. It may perhaps be less lucrative to some of the professors of medicine. But it seems to me more of medicine. But it seems to me more useful to the people; as they are in Italy much more generally, and even to the lowest, accommodated with the aid of physicians regularly bred, than the people in England. The young men who apply to surgery, get through the world exactly after the Q manner "
        ],
        [
            "226 manner of physieians. And as for the apothecaries, any body that chuses may set up for one, after having undergone proper examinations. But the physicians in every place of their residence are obliged to visit once a year at least the apothecaries shops, and have power to destroy all their decayed drugs and bad medicines. And here 1 must not omit to say, that within my memory the number of apothe¬ caries is considerably decreased in Italy; and I was credibly informed in my late ramble there, that, in Florence only, more than twenty of them were in less than three years obliged to leave off trade, as our physicians are generally be¬ comè averse to frequent prescriptions, and as cur apothecaries are not allowed to play the physicians, as they commonly do in England. With regard to those who apply to the study of the laws, they are more depen¬ dant on government than the physicians, surgeons, or apothecaries; for, when the government "

The Venetians value themselves much on their forcible eloquence, and think that their advocates are the only legitimate offspring of the ancient Roman orators, who certainly must have been very noisy speakers and great gesticulators, as they had often occasion to speak to multitudes more easily convinced by a strong tone of voice, and by violent motions of arms and hands, than by argument and reason. and hands, than by argument and reason.

Yet the academicians were not dismayed by the vast and dreary prospect. They parcelled out the in¬ tended work amongst the ablest of their fraternity, who made copious extracts of words from the books wrote in the three preceding ages; ranged them in alphabetical order; defined each word with much precision; marked their greater or less antiquity; distinguished the poetical from R 4 "

Such a performance on its first appear¬ ance was Iooked upon as a valuable acqui¬ sition to literature, and received by the learned with great and deserved applause. However it could not yet be considered as quite complete. Subsequent acade¬ micians now, that the first and greater encumbrances were in a good measure removed, retouched it in numberless places, and reprinted it several times both in the last and in the present age, carefully in the last and in the present age, carefully corrected and remarkably enlarged upon every new publication.

Of the many members of the academy who were employed in the forming of this important and necessary work, I will only mention Michelangelo Buonarroti, the author of the Tancia*, already mentioned.

I mean those peculiar and technical words used by those who exert the meanest crafts, and deal in the lowest necessaries of lise. To remove this difficulty Buonarroti composed a dramatic work of a very sin¬ gular kind. This was a comedy which consisted of five pieces, each of five acts, or rather a comedy of five and tventy F See page 182. acts. "

This odd drama was exhibited in Flo¬ tence at the expence of the sovereign for five nights successively; that is, five acts, five nights successively; that is, five acts, or one of the five comedies a night, and met with much applause. The great number of peculiar and technical words which Buonarroti brought into a small compass by means of this poetical expe¬ dient, is scarcely conceivable: and as his language is pure Tuscan, you may ima¬ gine that the academicians made good use of it in their dictionary. Besides givingus this bulky production, the academicians encreased the stock of the academicians encreased the stock of Italian literature with many other works, all tending to the greater embellishment and perfection of their tongue.

The Prose Fiorentine were dic¬ tated by too bigotted an affection to the dialect of their metropolis, which they long endeavoured to force upon all Italy as the only language to be emploved either in speech or in books. And as to their criticisms on Tassos Jerusalem, those that were emploved by the academy to examine whether it was to be admitted to examine whether it was to be admitted amongst their models of good language, betrayed too great a narrowness of mind in trying the language of such a poem by in trying the language of such a poem by the standard of the Florentine dialect, the standard of the Florentine dialect, and were justly taxed of overnicety and pedantry for having insisted with too much vehemence upon little imperfections with regard to grammar and syntax, passing over those blazes of genius which illu¬ minate every one of his cantos.

The inhabitants of that country lived on the mere products of their lands and flocks, and cultivated only those arts and flocks, and cultivated only those arts that are conducive to rural elegance and guiltless pleasure.

Some amongst our favourers of pastoral poetry have been so absurd as to pretend, that the wandering Arabs, and even many of the Tartar nations, have lived, and actually live such a lise, because they seed chiefly upon the product of their flocks and herds, and know so much of arts and sciences as to claim a wide difference from the savages of Africa and America. But are the manners of the Arabs and Tartars really those of poetical shepherds? Their robberies and continual incursions upon their neighbours, besides the general cast of their manners, would make but a very indifferent figure in pastoral poetry, which excludes all ideas of violence and rapine, or permits it only to wolves and foxes! Pastoral lise being then a mere S 2 creature    "

Our imaginary shepherds are in its kind. Our imaginary shepherds are therefore justly fallen into contempt, as it has been the case these many years. The Arcadian colonists are at last nearly annihi¬ lated throughout Italy; and the Arcadia Romana consists now only of a sew Aba¬ tinos, who still persist to meet sometimes in order to recite their meagre verses to each other; and they still chuse a Custode Generale, or Chief Herdsman, whose most important bufiness is to make a penny of his place; and this he chiesly effects by his place; and this he chiesly effects by sending Arcadian patente to the English travellers on their arrival at Rome; by which trick he aggregates their lordships and honours to the august body of the Roman Arcadians. Those patente are seldom refused, as they never cost above nine or ten shillings given to the Abatinos who "

By means of so small an expence their lordships and honours may become, if they chuse, di¬ rectly and intimately acquainted with very skilful managers of love-intrigues, as a good many of our present Arcadians are far from being so simple and innocent as the ancient ones of Greece. Besides the poor remains of the Crusca and the Arcadia, there are in Rome and in other of our towns other Academies composed of people who pretend to inge¬ nuity in one thing or other. At Rome there is the Accademia di San Luca, in which none but painters, statuaries, archi¬ tects, and engravers are admitted, and it matters not of what country or religion theyare. These academicians have chosen for their patron the evangelist St. Luke, changed into a painter by tradition, though he be termed a physician in holy writ. Some of our searchers into ancient records pretend, that in the twelfth cen¬ tury there lived one Mastro Luca of S 3 Cesena, "

They say that the Madona’s of Loretto, Bologna, Cara¬ vaggio, Varallo, and many others in Italy, now very miraculous, owe their forma¬ tion to this artist, whose ingenuity bore but little proportion to his piety. The christian name of this Mastro Luca was Santo. Hence arose the vulgar notion that those Madona’s were painted by St. Luke. Whatever truth there be in this scrap of erudition, this notion has spread so far and wide, that the famous Neustra Senora del Pillar actually worshipped in Saragozza, and that still more famous of Monserrate in Catalonia, were likewise St. Lukes works in the opinion of the Spa¬ niards.

Mr. Sharp says, that very few Italian gentlemen practise the fiddle or any other instrument: that all the joung ladies (take notice of his emphatical word ALL) are placed in convents, where they remain until they marry or take the veil, and where music is no part of their education; and that after U marriage "

For these reasons, does he add with great wis¬ dom, an Italian audience has no other plea¬ sure in melody than what pure nature affords; whereas in England the fine ladies have also an acquired taste, the effects of assiduity and an acquired taste, the effects of assiduity and cultivation. These, with Mr. Sharp’s leave, are the remarks of a careles talker, who has little to say, and vet is resolved to say some¬ to say, and vet is resolved to say some¬ thing right or wrong. What opportunity could Mr. Sharp have of ascertaining the number of those Italian gentlemen who practise the fiddle or other instruments? And by what means did he discover that none of the Italian ladies are taught music? However it is true that few Italian gentlemen practise the fiddle or other in¬ struments, relatively to the number of those Italian gentlemen who do not: and if this meaning, he is certainly right. But is his meaning, he is certainly right. But if "

            "I 291 if he means relatively to the number of the English gentlemen who do it, it will be very difficult for him to prove such an assertion: and I for my part am far an assertion: and I for my part am far from subscribing to it, as I have visited many more tovns of Italy than he has done, and know that in each of them many gentlemen apply to music. Yet, as it is impossible to ascertam this point, Iwill give it up with all my heart, and grant that the balance is in favour of England: but I must say at the same time, that if there are but sew amongst cur gentlemen who practise the fiddle or other instruments relatively to the number of those who do not, this happens because the Italians in general do not Iook with any additional degree of regard upon a gentleman on account of his attaining to any excellence in music. And so far they seem to me not to differ greatly from the English, who value a gentleman not much the more for his being a good fiddler or singer. U 2 It "

The music of Italy, though much more scien¬ tific than that of other European coun¬ tries, naturally tends to enervate the mind. Hence our Italian performers, though in the lump justly preferred to all other per¬ the lump justly preferred to all other per¬ formers of Europe for superior powers of delighting, are justly derided for greater effeminacy and folly. It is difficult to tell why logic and common sense forsake so many of them when music is out of the question; and vet this generally the case, though music, like all other arts and sciences, has its foundation in common sense and logic.

The Italians therefore, Imean those of weight and consideration, as well as the English, are perhaps not so as well as the English, are perhaps not so blameable when they contemn those puny gentlemen, who acquire such skill in this charming art, as to feel its minutest nice¬ ties, and be of course in rapture with the languishing Cecchinas of Piccini, and the fainting Pastorella’s of Galuppi.

With regard to the second, I must take the liberty to deny what he has in his letters repeatedly affirmed with great confidence, that the Italians place all their young ladies in convents, and leave them there until they take the veil or marry. But as the confutation of this assertion, which he has copied out of Missons* travels, would lead me too far from the present subject, which is the manners and customs of the Italians with regard to * Misson says in one place, that the Italians sand their giris to monasteries in their infancy, and dispose of their giris to monasteries in their infancy, and dispose of them in marriage without their knowledge, and even fre¬ quently without letting them see their future husbands, and that in making marriages they do not trouble themselves with love, affection, or esteem, but mind nothing, save kindred and riches. And in another Place, Not only at Venice, but every where else, the girls are sent to nunneries in their infancy, and they are usually married or at least in their infancy, and they are usually married or at least betrothed without seeing their huspands.

And perhaps cur nobility and genteel people are far from being wholly in the wrong when they think music no in the wrong when they think music no very great, and in some respects a dange¬ rous accomplishment in women.

A similar motive induces the Italians to keep their signorinas from learning music, as they are sensible that music, though perfectly guiltless in itself, would certainly discompose their little hearts, and more easily perhaps than the indecencies of a British stage. There is likewise another motive which keeps Italian parents from letting their giris turn musical. Imean the general character of immorality which cur best singers and masters of music have seemed studious to acquire in this age. Mr. Locke, in his treatise on education, recom¬ mended some manual trade for well-born children, by way of furnishing them with an innocent occupation in their leisure hours when arrived at the years of man¬ hood. But Mr. LockeS recommendation has been justly disregarded by his country¬ men; because manual trades cannot be taught but by base mechanics, whose lov manners I "

The Italian parents would have a greater inconvenience to contend with, should they venture to make their girls great proficients in music. They are therefore right when they avoid this dan¬ ger, or vhen they suffer them only to learn a little from musical women; which they condescend to do in several of our tovns, and especially in Venice, wnose musical hospitals furnisni them vith semale teachers, who know so much of plaving and singing as to be able to give a giri some little taste of both, but cannot easily lead her to that excellence in musie which might prove pernicious to innocence and virtue. Such is the voluptuous and vicked turn of mind that music gives in Italy to the generality of its professors, the fingers especially, that it has brought them into universal disrepute. So great is the con¬ tempt which our fingers have long merited pf us by their corruption, that no ex¬ cellence "

They do not indeed in Italy rank vith the nobility; nor do they in any country: but they have their they in any country: but they have their natural degree of estimation, and these employments are neither despised nor de¬ tested.

Mr. Sharp, inconsistent with himself, and forgetful at times of cur characteristical hatred to laborious em¬ ployments, has hinted several times in his book at the perfection of our agriculture. He has said, that it is hardly to be expres¬ sed how beautiful the environs of Ancona are; that the vineyards and arable grounds X there "

As to manufactures, no body but Mr. Sharp will ever dream that the Italians detest them.
