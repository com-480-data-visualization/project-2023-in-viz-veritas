Lorenzo died during the second voyage of his literary agent. Lascaris remained in lettered solitude for some years ; but, though the in¬ vasion of Italy by the French did not divert him from his studies, yet the intreaties of Charles VIII. induced him to remove to Paris. His residence in France was neither long, nor, in a literary sense, important. Louis XII., the successor of Charles VIII., appointed him his ambassador at Venice. Lascaris kept his abode in that city after the dissolution of its friend¬ ship with the monarch whom he hadorepre¬ sented, and occupied himself in the pleasing task of communicating to the Venetians the language and literature of his native country. He always preserved the regard of the Medicean family; and, when the Cardinal Giovanni, son of his patron Lorenzo, became Pope Leo X., Lascaris repaired to Rome, in order to give life and action to a well-concerted scheme for invigorat¬ ing the prevailing taste for ancient literature. ing the prevailing taste for ancient literature. 9                               "

It was intended that they should be placed under the care of Lascaris, as their master in classical letters ; for his acquaintance with Latin was considerable, and his perfect command over the most copious of all lan¬ guages had been displayed in his editions of the Greek Anthology, the hymns of Callimachus, and many of the tragedies of Euripides. Las¬ caris was commanded by the Pope to educate his pupils with a view to their ability of teaching the Greek language to the Italians. The the Greek language to the Italians.

Musurus, when the commission was received by him, turned his eyes to Crete, not only from love to country, but as being the most literary of all the places which, at that time, contained the remains of Greece. There were schools and libraries in Candia, and the other cities of the island ; and, while learning was the ornament of every Greek B 3                               "

Some libraries in Europe possess manuscripts, which, according to their introductions, were transcribed by Angelus Vergecius, Antonius Damilas, Michael Apostolius, and many others, all residents in Crete. Of that island was the scholar Demetrius, whose learned aid was so important towards the publication of the Floren- tine Homer, of the year 1488, and whose critical sagacity was afterwards engaged by the Cardinal Ximenes, for the editing of the Complutensian Polyglott Bible. Several printers of the classics are Cretans. No one is better known than Zaccaria Calliergus, who, from the year 1499 to the year 1513, printed several Greek authors at Venice, at the expence of his countryman at Venice, at the expence of his countryman Nicolaus Blastus, and afterwards was the director of the press at Rome, founded at the charges of Agostino Chigi, a rich merchant, originally of Sienna, and whose Medicean taste gave grace and dignity to his wealth. From that press issued editions of Pindar and Theo¬ critus, the first Greek books that ever were printed at Rome. (1)                              "

            "7 HISTORY OF DUCAS. My father, Demetrius Ducas, had lived for many vears in Candia. He had been long as¬ sociated in friendship with Musurus; and, there- fore, from private regard as well às general considerations, the agent of the Pope offered a place in the College to one of my family. The hope of recovering national independence for- bade my father from parting with his eldest son, who was advanced to maturity, and, therefore, the stay of his declining years; but, in behalf of myself, his second child, he accepted Musurus' offer of an introduction into the Greek dao en Institute. a jo  Larrived at Rome in the month of January, in the year 1514. I was then in my fourteenth in the year 1514. I was then in my fourteenth vear. Under the able instruction of Lascaris and his friends (for he was, towards the close of my studies, absent on a second journey to Paris) I acquired, in the course of six years, the Latin language, and also some of the vernacular idioms of Europe. I studied critically the various dialects of antient Greece; and, in the course of these philological inquiries, I became ac¬ quainted with the philosophers and historians of old, the most faithful painters of the opinions of old, the most faithful painters of the opinions and actions of men. I also gave some slight assistance to the first editions of the ancient B 4                                   "

His Holiness responded to this eulogium by his bulls, wherein he commended the College, and threatened with eternal punishment all those, who, during the ensuing ten years, should dare to injure the copyright of the Gymnasium. My literary acquisitions fitted me for the office of classical professor, agréeably to the intention of the Institute. I was not pleased, however, with the prospect of the diurnal labours of an academy; yet, had of the diurnal labours of an academy; yet, had circumstances required my stay at Rome, gra¬ titude to the Pope would have stifled all feelings of discontent.

Totally unconnected as lwas I with the politics of any country of the West, was not liable to one great source of hostility. As a member of the Greek church, it might, at first view, appear that I should be obnoxious to every class of the religionists of the time; but the Christians of Europe, unlike their ancestors, the Christians of Europe, unlike their ancestors, were not animated by the wish of compelling the Greeks to enter into the pale of the Latin church : they suffered some compunction, that their own discords had enabled the Turk to destroy the great Christian empire of the East; and, in the mighty contention between Catholics and Pro¬ I testants, all minor differences were forgotten. resolved to pass over, in decorous silence, the religious observances of people that I visited; and not exclaim, as my countryman Leontius Pilatus did, in a church at Venice, —“ 1 cannot endure the follies of the Latins.\" « If the con¬ gregation had heard him,\" says Petrarça, « he would have been stoned.\" I intended to travel for the declared purpose of marking the state of literature and the arts; and 1 hoped that a Greek would be received with courtesy at a time when, as the elder Aldo the printer says, the number of young men who devoted them- the number of young men who devoted them- selves to Grecian letters equalled the students of                                "

IN the interim of my forming and commenc¬ ing the execution of my plan of travels, I mourned the loss of my father's friend, Marcus Musurus, and my literary patron, Pope Leo X. The former was remarkable for being one of the few refugee Greeks who understood the Latin as thoroughly as their own language. Erasmus, as thoroughly as their own language. Erasmus, an incomparable judge, used to say, that Mu¬ surus' latinity was miraculously perfect. Mu¬ surus had been a pupil of John Lascaris, and during many years a lecturer on classical litera¬ ture at Padua and Venice; and with such ardour did he fulfil his literary duties, that he was not absent from his professor's chair four days in any one year. He assisted Aldo the elder in collating the manuscripts, and revising the print¬ ing of many Greek authors. He was, indeed, a stipendiary corrector of the Aldine press. Mu¬ surus' verses, which were prefixed to the first (the Aldine) edition of the works of Plato, are the finest specimen of modern Greek composi¬                           "

Plato, accompanied by Lascaris and Bembo, would seek the father of the Western Christians, and, presenting his works to him as the offering of Aldo, would, in return for the dedication, implore him to terminate all civil wars, and call upon the chivalrous nations of Europe to engage their hopes of fame in that of Europe to engage their hopes of fame in that more glorious cause— the restoration of the Gre¬ cian empire. But till the arts should flourish again their native soil, Plato entreated his Holiness to prevent their decay, and in particu¬ lar to provide in Rome a retreat for the exiled muses which might rival the academy at Atbens, so that the ingenuous youth of Greece should find the shores of the Tiber as rich in literary enjoyments as the banks of the Ilissus.

Aldo, in the prefaces to many of the classics which he published, grate¬ fully mentions his learned typographical assist¬ ant. On the invitation of the Pope, whom he had so elegantly complimented, Musurus came to Rome in the year 1516, and was appointed to the archbishopric of Malvasia in the Morea; the archbishopric of Malvasia in the Morea; but he died a few months after the nomination, and before he could take possession of his dig- nity.

In recalling to their minds the events which preceded his election to the papacy,I have heard the courtiers of the Vatican dwell upon his rare merits, as the cause that his pro¬ motion had not been regulated by the usual scale of age and advancement. It would have evinced more respect for truth to have attributed some of his honours to the power and conse¬ quence of his family. He was admitted into holy orders at the early age of seven. Soon afterwards, the French King, Louis XI., ap¬ pointed him to the archbishopric of Aix, in Provence, and then to the abbacy of Pasignano; when it was found that the Archbishop, supposed to be dead, had not yet closed his mortal career. Pope Innocent VIII. gave Giovanni a cardinal's hat, when he was but thirteen years old; an honour which had never before been enjoyed by any individual of the Medici family ; nor could the annals of the Western church, full of corrup¬ the annals of the Western church, full of corrup¬ tion and simony as they are, furnish an example of such a distinction so prematurely conferred.

Many writers have graced the character of Charlemagne with the love of letters; but if that renowned con¬ queror gave some slight impulse to learning, the wars of his family certainly checked that impulse; and it is more a matter of literary curiosity than of useful speculation, to enquire into the fate of those schools in Italy which were founded by his grandson Lothaire. The tenth century is gene¬ rally considered as the darkest in the modern annals of the human race. In the next agewe may observe the faint dawnings of letters in the estab¬ lishing of schools for furnishing ministers to the Church. In those schools knowledge was divided into the Trivium and the Quadrivium: the for¬ mer division comprising grammar, rhetoric, and logic; the latter portion including arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.

But all friendly and literary communion was well nigh extin¬ guished, when papal Rome threw off the Con¬ stantinopolitan yoke; and polemical disputes were so malevolent, that the Greeks considered themselves contaminated, if they entertained the slightest intercourse with the Latins. In the days of peaceful pilgrimages, the palmers to the holy sepulchre rested at Constantinople: but when the staff was thrown aside for the lance, the crusades embittered the theological hatred which existed since the commencement of the great schism of the Roman and Byzantine churches, because the Greeks were charged by the Latins with the Greeks were charged by the Latins with pusillanimity in the common cause of Christen¬ dom, and even with the greater crime of having aided the Saracens. In all ages, however, Italy traded with Greece: commerce softened the prejudices of both people, and gave rise to libe¬ ral and intellectual connections. Greece, like Europe, had suffered ages of barbarism; but she antedated the West in the re-assumption of lite¬ rary honours. The ninth century is remarked as the æra of this change.

The schools were generally respected amidst the tu¬ mults of war; and if a victorious soldiery, more rude than the general tone of military feeling, banished a professor and his class, as soon as order was re-established they were recalled to their peaceful labours. In the infancy of letters this patronage of science by the wealthy and powerful was essentially necessary to the growth of learning, for without pecuniary support during a long-continued application of talents, works of learning would not have been compiled; and, in times when reading was not the occupa¬ tion of general society, men of letters were com¬ pelled to court the favouring eye of princes.

When the fountains of classical waters poured their streams into a world of seeming barrenness, those who observed the new life and beauty around them, and thought of the slight causes and the accidents that had effected the change, naturally were curious to enquire whether all the sources of wisdom had been opened. It was known that the love of the Roman emperors for the Christian religion had been measured by their the Christian religion had been measured by their persecution of the Pagan philosophy. The severe orthodoxy of Theodosius was blown by Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, into a devouring flame. The emperor revoked all the tolerating decrees of his predecessors, and proscribed the ancient religion of Rome. Imperial orders were scarcely necessary to excite the fury of ignorant and vindictive monks against the works that contained the mythology of the Greek and Ro- man world. The finest statues and most magni- ficent temples were delivered to the fanatics, and even the libraries were despoiled or burnt. This ardour against Paganism was kept alive till its object was destroyed by Justinian, who, in the year 529, closed the schools at Athens the year 529, closed the schools at Athens wherein Plato and Aristotle were taught.

The laity were enjoined to read the « divine\" poems of St. Gregory of Nazianzen, instead of the amatory effusions of the Grecian muse. A council of Carthage forbade bishops from reading classical authors; and Jerom, whose authority was not inferior to that of any council, censured the young clergy for studying come¬ dies and Virgil, to the neglect of the prophets and evangelists.

Petrarça was zealous as his friend Boc¬ caccio in searching for manuscripts. His letters are full of interesting details on the subject. Niccolo Niccoli, a learned Florentine merchant, amassed a large collection of manuscripts. He often transcribed his originals, and corrected the errors of former copyists. Indeed, he may be regarded as the father of verbal criticism. He was the first, too, who in modern times con¬ ceived the idea of forming a library for public use.

But, notwithstanding these glorious proofs of native ability, the love of classical letters sus¬ pended, in an extraordinary manner, the pro¬ gress of all other excellence. Italian pride was more exalted in regarding the sages of old as Italians, than in founding new pretensions to fame. In the political convulsions of Italy, perpetual references were made to Roman in¬ stitutions, and the mind, therefore, naturally reverted to Roman literature.

The Pope not only re¬ warded the discoverer of the treasure, but patronized the printing of the work. At the foot of the papal arms, on books that had been published under papal patronage, there was often added a promise of reward to those who would present unedited manuscripts to the Pope. Leo must ever be venerated for enlarg- ing the Vatican Library, re-establishing the Ro¬ ing the Vatican Library, re-establishing the Ro¬ man University, and creating the Greek Gym- nasium. He founded an oriental printing-press at Rome. The first Arabic printing-press in Europe had been set up at Fano, under the auspices of Pope Julius II.: the earliest book that issued from it bears date in the year 1514. Leo's mind had been accomplished in literature by Angelo Poliziano and Demetrius of Chalcis, two of the most finished Greek scholars of the fifteenth century. Indeed, no man possessed more elegant scholarship than Leo. The habits of his education led him to prefer the classics to the fathers; and, as he was more a Mecænas the fathers; and, as he was more a Mecænas than a bishop, the opinion of the world was naturally formed, that profane literature shared an undue portion of his patronage. Doubtless, the quality of his mind influenced his conduct; but it is equally true that learned theologians                              "

Many men of genius found in Leo an affectionate and generous patron ; and I wish that his de¬ and generous patron ; and I wish that his de¬ portment in the literary world had always been so judicious as to warrant the opinion, that his love of intellectual ability was a passion that dwelt in his mind in purity and singleness of feeling: but Ariosto, who ranks with Dante and Petrarca, was contemptuously slighted by him; and the genius of Michelangiolo was suf- fered to lie waste in some Florentine stone¬ quarries. Nor did Lionardo da Vinci enjoy any larger share of papal patronage. Leo befriended Paolo Govio and Pietro Aretino, indeed; men who were as detestable for the immorality of their lives, as for the ven¬ the immorality of their lives, as for the ven¬ ality of their pens. The latter writer, how- ever, sometimes recorded facts ; and much do I regret, that my duty to truth compels me to point out the shades in Leo's character. It was difficult to judge, Aretino said, whether the merit of the learned, or the tricks of buffoons, afforded most delight to the Pope. The de¬ formities and vices, the negligencies and errors of men, were made a matter of mirth. Even of men, were made a matter of mirth. Even idiotcy was laughed at.

To the extemporaneous poetry of Andrea de Mara, the wisest men might have listened ; but what polished mind could take delight in crowning Querno of Mo- nopoli with a wreath of cabbage and laurel, in seeing him eat to excess, and hearing the wretched fool recite his doggerel rhymes. Agostino Nifo, who had been a Professor of Philosophy at Naples and Padua for several years, was caressed by Leo. The clergy had censured the Professor for maintaining the general opinion of the philosophers of old, that the souls of men were parts of one spirit or emanation of the Deity, into which they would resolve on the dissolution of the body. Nifo very prudently renounced his heresies, and wrote, with the fury of a partizan, on the ortho- dox side of the question. His learning was prodigious, and he occasionally laboured in his study with most intense application. His merits as a philosopher, however, were not so much the subject of admiration, as the immorality of the subject of admiration, as the immorality of his conduct was the subject of ridicule. His amatory follies formed a constant topic of mirth at the table of the Pope.

But I will dwell no longer upon these shades in the character of Leo.

He could hate violently as well as love warmly; but his nature inclined him more to affection than to enmity. He lived nearly ten years at Florence.

So much of Berni's satire is personal and local, and its sense is so often dependant upon the right understanding of colloquial phrases, that the endeavour would be vain to transfuse it into another language. In burlesque poetry, he was the first among the Italians that attained any eminence. He uses familiar and even vulgar expressions to describe the most serious and afflicting circumstances, and paints the most trifling matters in solemn language.

It is not worth while to follow the pre- sent subject of notice through all the events of his life : it is sufficient to say that he pursued his selfish ends by crooked means, and found his reward in several valuable stations in the church, (though he was originally a physician,) particu¬ larly in the sinecure bishopric of Nocera, in the kingdom of Naples. After the death of Leo, he lived in a magnificent palace which he built on the ruins of Pliny's villa, near the Lago di Como. the ruins of Pliny's villa, near the Lago di Como. He consumed his wealth in sensual luxury, as well as in the liberal arts, and was not anxious to revive the primitive decorum of the episcopal character. His General History of the World, from the year 1494 to 1547, is his most cele¬ brated work. The elegance of the narrative has gained great admiration; but the author can never be implicitly relied upon, for he was defi¬ cient in literary honesty. He was not a faithful chronicler. His own confessions, however, have prevented his readers from being deceived, and at the same time have made a lamentable ex¬ posure of many public characters. He avows that he had two pens, one of gold, the other of                            "

He offered his pen to Don Juan III., King of Portugal; and, because that Sovereign would not accept his services, he made no mention of a victory which gave consequence and renown to the Portuguese. If he had been well paid to write the history of Portugal, he would have inserted imaginary victories in his work rather than have suppressed the true ones. The Emperor Charles V., the French King Francis I., many of the Medicean Princes, and the Dukes of Ferrara, Mantua, Milan, and Urbino, paid for the eulogiums of this literary profligate. There is a pleasant story told of Govio and Pope Hadrian VI. His Holiness took from the hist- orian the pension and the title which Leo X. had given to him; but he appointed him to a canonry in the cathedral of Como, upon the express condition that Govio should celebrate him in his history. The meed of praise was poured forth. But in another work, (the Treatise de Romanis Piscibus,) published a year after Hadrian's death, Govio speaks of that Pope in terms of sovereign contempt, exhibiting him as a man perfectly stupid, and                              "

He gave Govio a benefice, tell¬ ing him that he did so because he was a learned man, an elegant writer, and no poet. (13) VALERIANO.

Poverty weighed so heavily upon him, that he was fifteen years old before he could acquire the merest rudiments of literature. His uncle, a poor but learned churchman, invited him to a poor but learned churchman, invited him to Venice; and the young aspirant after literary honours was compelled to perform menial ser¬ vices in the houses of some of the Venetian nobility.

He wrote Latin poetry, but with more correct- ness than genius. His work on Egyptian anti¬ quities displays a vast compass of erudition. He published also an account of his native city Bel¬ luno. His apologetical discourse for the clergy wearing beards was dedicated to his former pupil, the Cardinal Ippolito, and was printed in the year 1533.

(22) From this time, September, 1508, Rafaello's greatness commenced. His first works at Rome were in a hall of the Vatican, called the Camera di Signatura. He has represented on the roof theology, philosophy, poesy, and jurisprudence, each by an expressive emblem; and has more fully characterized those subjects underneath by large pictures surmounting a freize, which, with its caryatides, was painted by Polidoro Caravag- gio, after Rafaello's designs. The first painting which Rafaello finished was that of theology generally known under the name of the Dispute upon the Sacrament. In this picture there is more of the dryness of Perugino than the elegance of Masaccio; and Rafaello, not having yet risen above his age, has made a confession of poverty in his art, by describing the rays of glory round in his art, by describing the rays of glory round Jesus Christ and the saints by bands of gold.

The occupation of à painter was not at that time the surest road to fame or fortune; and therefore it was with the greatest regret that the father of Michelangiolo yielded to his son's inclinations, and articled him (at the age of fourteen) as an apprentice to Ghirlandaio for three years. The youth was soon admitted a student of the statues and other, remains of the antique, which, for the advance¬ 10                               "

The noble friend of art, in regarding the effects of his pa¬ tronage, admired the ability with which Michel¬ angiolo imitated an ancient head of a Faun ; but gently reminded him of the impropriety of put- ting a full set of teeth in the head of an old man. The young artist, immediately after the depar¬ ture of his illustrious critic, made the jaw wear the appearance of a tooth having fallen out. Lorenzo, on returning, smiled at his docility; and Michelangiolo soon became a favourite companion of that distinguished rewarder of merit. At that time the student was fifteen years of age. This head of the Faun is still at Florence, and is shown to the curious in art. The intercourse between Lorenzo and Bonar- ruoti continued until the death of the former in 1492. Michelangiolo remained with Piero, Lorenzo’s successor in rank, but not the in¬ heritor of his ability and taste, for two years, when political storms drove them both from Florence. The artist, during his residence with the Medici, devoted his mind to the study of the Medici, devoted his mind to the study of sculpture; and one of his earliest performances, namely, a basso relievo of the battle of Hercules with the Centaurs, was regarded, not as the                              "

For about three years he pursued uninterruptedly the pro- fession of a sculptor; and it is remarkable that he who was afterwards the restorer of the epic dig¬ nity of art now represented the softness and repose of nature in figures of a sleeping Cupid and a St. John.

It was, however, untouched during the pontificate of Leo X., for that pontiff was never solicitous for the display of Michelangiolo's talents. Several more years passed away with- out the performance of monumental honours to Julius, deeply to the vexation of the artist. The executors were narrow-minded and illiberal; the plans and agreements were thrice changed; and it was not till the pontificate of Paul III. that all obstacles were removed, and the work was finished and erected, not in the new cathedral, its original destination, but in the church of S.

It had been originally intended that six sta¬ tues, the work of Michelangiolo's hand, should ornament the monument; but Paul III. was anxious to engage the artist on other sub¬ jects (43); and therefore prevailed upon the friends of Julius that the number should be reduced to thrée.

I never could per¬ fectly understand the reason that prompted him to engage an artist in a description of work in which he possessed no experience. Most probably it proceeded from that unbounded ad¬ miration which Julius entertained for him, and an unlimited confidence in his powers. The opinion, however, was common among the friends of Michelangiolo, that Julius was incited to the measure by Bramante, who, on his own and his relation's account, envied the talents of Michelangiolo, and the favour of that artist with the Pope; and, therefore, wished to engage him the Pope; and, therefore, wished to engage him                              "

On the 18th of April, 1506, Julius II. placed the first stone.

The four enormous pillars of the cupola were raised, each of them being one hun- dred and eighty feet in height, and two hundred and forty feet in circumference. The inter¬ mediate arches were also finished by Bramante, and the western branch of the cross was con- siderably advanced. After the death of the prelate and his architect, Pope Leo X. appointed Giuliano San Gallo, Father Giocondo, and the great Rafaello, to carry on the work.

When the new architects investigated the subject, they found a vast disproportion between the intended cupola, and the pillars designed forits support. The cupola, meant to be of the dimensions of the Pantheon, and highly ornamented with columns, would have been an enormous and overwhelming mass. The pillars, indeed, already seemed to be inade- quate to their object. The foundations of the church were now suspected to be insecure: and it was necessary that the labours of reparation should precede those of advancement.

A courtier -bishop in attendance, who for once mistook the feeling in his master's mind, officiously entreated pardon for the artist on the ground of his igno¬ rance of the world.

In a letter to a friend he says, that, he who had in life made life valuable to him, had in death taught him to die, not only without regret, but with desire of death. * He was a most faithful servant to me for twenty-six years, and when I hoped to find him the staff and repose of my old age, he is taken from me, and there remains only the hope of seeing him in Paradise. That he is gone thither, God has shown to me by the tranquillity of his death. The thoughts of death did not distress him so much as the idea of leaving me in this treacherous world with so many troubles about me.\" (57) It was on a morning in the early part of Fe¬ bruary, 1563, that I recorded this amiable trait in the private history of Michelangiolo, and I was musing on the age and worldly state of the artist, when the public news reached me that the I subject of my reflections was ill of a fever. immediately went to his house, and I saw there the painter Daniello da Volterra, who confirmed the rumour, adding the circumstance, that, by the                               "

The Germans affirmed that their nation was the original one. The art in question immediately followed that of printing, which was undoubtedly of transalpine birth. Even in printing cards of amusement, Germany antedated Italy. Originally the figures of those cards were marked with a pen, or painted with a brush; but the engraving of them on wood, a brush; but the engraving of them on wood, and then taking the required impressions, were arts which were practised in Germany in the vear 1376. In Italy, however, the original practice was not worn out even in the fifteenth century, as is apparent from a decree of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan. The art of multiplying copies of any impres¬ sion was soon applied to more important ends than those of mere amusement. Figures of saints with short legends were printed, and many other books on subjects of the popular religion succeeded. The art was employed in order to furnish the poor with that knowledge which the paucity and expence of manuscripts kept from them. Almanacks likewise were made.

In the progress of improvement, the use of metal types was the next and greatest the use of metal types was the next and greatest step. It was seen that impressions of words could be taken from metal types; and the idea that impressions of figures could be taken soon followed. Thus block-printing was the original both of letter-press printing and of copper-plate printing. Particular facts supported this general historical statement. Many impressions from engraved coppers were dated before the time which the Italians set up as the æra of their dis¬ covery; and Martino Schoen, of Culmbach in Franconia, who died in 1486, practised the art before Finiguerra. On the other hand, the Italians denied the priority of the Germans even in wood en¬ graving. That art, they said, had been practised at Ravenna so early as the year 1285; and the only fair conclusion from the Milan decree was, that wood engraving had not altogether super¬ seded the ancient practice. A decree of the Venetian Senate, in 1441, forbids all cards and pictures to be sold in Venice, unless they were engraved by Venetian artists. This decree is evidence of the general practice of the art in other cities. With respect to chalcography, without entering into the subject of the connec¬                              "

The goldsmiths used to work the golden ornaments for churches, and the various ornaments of domestic luxury. They are engravers, medallists, and embossers, and, a circumstance more perhaps to the present purpose, workers in niello. The artist designs his ornaments with a point of steel on the silver utensil, and then engraves them with his burin. His niello is a composition of silver, lead, copper, sulphur, and borax, which being mixed over a fire becomes black and brittle. He lays the niello on the engraved plate, which is placed near a fire of green wood, and the flame driven on the niello dissolves it, and in that state the niello fills the engraving. To judge of the effect, or to preserve a memorial of his work, the artist or to preserve a memorial of his work, the artist was accustomed to take an impression fine earth of his engravings in silver; on this impres¬ sion he used to pour liquid sulphur, which, when it became cold and the earth was removed, and the cavities were filled with a mixture of soot and oil, exhibited an appearance similar to that of the silver, with its chiaroscuro of niello.

He did so, and the impressions thus produced looked like drawings made with a pen.

So great indeed was the influx from the north at the close of the fifteenth century, that, for the convenience of strangers, dictionaries of the German language were printed at Venice, in the vear 1475, and at Bologna in 1479. The deci¬ sion of the question of priority may be facilitated by the following consideration. Typography was invented in Germany, and gradually per- fected from wooden blocks to wooden separate characters, and then to metal types. The Italians, without passing through these degrees of imperfection, received the art from Germany, printed books, and ornamented them with en¬ graved plates. But the German engravings show none of those steps in improvement which German typography exhibits.

The pomp and luxury of oriental courts were imi¬ tated, the grossness of pleasure was concealed under the mantle of intellectual taste, and the ornamented diction of the east became the vehi¬ cle of sentiment and passion. The mind, there¬ fore, revelled amidst splendid images, and ex¬ pressed itself in poetry. No wonder that Dante has called Sicily the cradle of Italian letters.

Every thing that was written first appeared at the Sicilian court, and was called Sicilian, whether composed in the dialect of the island or not. The Sicilians acquired the poetry of the Saracens and Greeks, and in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Charles of An- of the thirteenth century, when Charles of An- jou, King of Sicily and brother of the French monarch, married the daughter of Raymond Berenger Count of Provence, the Troubadour poetry was engrafted on the Italian stock. The subject of the Sicilian poets was love. But it was a phantasy of the imagination more than a passion of the heart. There was exaggeration instead of simplicity, metaphysical refinement for sentiment and emotion. The peace and war of lovers, the movements and vicissitudes of the affections, were never sung ; and, instead of the transports, hopes, and recollections of passion, we meet with wild allegories, imaginary ecstasies, and logical disputes between the poet and the and logical disputes between the poet and the creature of his fancy, (for a real woman is never seen,) on the nature of love.

This opinion is totally des¬ titute of proof. Equally untenable is the posi¬ tion that the Italian is the original Latin, cor¬ rupted only by national vulgarisms. But the origin of the Italian language, in the manner I have first stated, is the assertion of the best Italian scholars, who justify themselves by historical evidence and philological analysis. The Latin and the new dialects struggled long for pre-eminence, but at the close of the twelfth century the classical language was so little known by the people, that sermons used to be preached in Latin as the idiom of the great, and then read in the ordinary or vulgar dialect, as the Italian tongue was called, for the edification of the lower classes. The first literary appearance of the popular idiom was in poetry. Dante speaks of the vernacular dialect as having existed only one hundred and fifty years, and of its being used by poets to please their mistresses, who were but imperfectly acquainted with Latin. Dante himself commenced his great poem in classical numbers, but soon re-wrote that part, and continued the work in Italian, in order that 2                               "

Christianity and Mythology are regarded by Sannazaro as equally emanating from the same source of truth.

It is a poor compensation for these absurdities to say that the Latinity ofthe poem is correct and elegant. So great, however, is the fashion for classical literature, that Pope Clement VII., the father of the Western church, has patronized the poem of Sannazaro; and to rival the impropriety of the author, his Holiness gravely assures him, that fame is the image of the immortality offered to man by the Christian religion.

Giotto, the cele¬ brated Florentine, was invited by King Robert to Naples, and he left in the city many memorials of his genius. Antonio Solario, or Zingaro, was an artist of great merit ; he lived in the first half of the fifteenth century. The history, or perhaps the romance of his life, tells us that he directed his genius to painting, in order to ob¬ tain the hand of his mistress, whose father, Colantonio del Fiore, an artist, declared that he would bestow her only upon a painter. In ten years study in most of the Italian cities, Zingaro laid the foundations of his happiness and fame. His love was blessed, and he became an artist of celebrity. His most famous works are in the convent of St. Severino; they represent the life of San Benedetto; they are in fresco, and con- tain an incredible variety of figures and things.

Latini, a Florentine, and who is described as a master of all thescience of the age, instructed him in the elementary branches of knowledge. Dante o 2                              "

He was in love, and wrote poetry in very early youth: his mistress died when she and Dante were both twenty five years old. His love was, we will hope, an affair of the imagination rather than of the an affair of the imagination rather than of the heart, for Boccaccio asserts, in his commentary on the second canto of the Inferno, that thelady died the wife of a Florentine gentleman. Dante cele¬ brated his early attachment in many a sonnet and canzone, and in a work which he called the Vita Nuova. That work is a mixture of prose and poetry. Some of his minor poems are full of common thoughts, expressed in common lan¬ common thoughts, expressed in common lan¬ guage.  Others have all the concetti and meta¬ physical subtleties which I have already said characterized the early ages of Italian poetry But sometimes there are indications of the gran¬ deur of idea and vigour of style of the Divina Commedia ; and occasionally a strain of ardent or melancholy fondness is breathed, which Pe¬ trarca might have envied. With a noble con¬ sciousness of superior powers, he tells his Beatrice that he will one day celebrate her in a way in which no woman had ever been distinguished.                                  "

His wife was a Xantippe, instead of being the personification of a poet's fancy. But she was a woman of spirit and talent ; and when her hus- band was banished from Florence, she wrung from the state a decree for her dowry (treating the banishment as a civil death,) and was thus enabled to sustain her family.

The embers of civil war were rekindled by the heads of two factions of Pistoia, who removed their dissensions to Florence.

On the other hand, every city of Italy which the poet visited in the course of his exile, has claimed the honour of being the seat of his muse. The story of the Divina Commedia is briefly as follows:— Dante found himself once, by means which he knew not, in a forest near Je¬ rusalem. Wild beasts threatened to devour him. Virgil appears; and, in answer to his sup- plications for aid, offers to conduct him from thence, as the sole mode of escape, through those two worlds of shades, where sinful men are either suffering woes which will be eternal, or are expiating their offences, and preparing themselves for another state. But Virgil is con¬ sidered as a rebellious spirit, and, therefore, after the infernal and purgatorial regions are passed, some worthier being must conduct him to hea¬ ven.

In resolving to make, at all hazards, the third book as long as each of the others, Dante the third book as long as each of the others, Dante did not consider the dangers of prolixity. Metaphysical and scholastic subtleties appear occasionally in the Purgatory, but they abound to satiety in the Paradise. Poetry, the language of passion, is ill calculated for discussions on the nature of angels, free will, original sin, andthe mys- teries of redemption. The various astronomical remarks, and the occasional medical theories, are not, apparently, of heavenly or of scientific origin.

The inability of man to describe celestial bliss ought to have repressed the muse of Dante; but the pious humility of confessing ignorance was no part of the religion of the time. Consistently with the best principles of religion, Dante has made tranquillity one species of happiness. But tranquillity is a point, and admits of no descrip¬ tion. Call in recollection, and ideas of pain as well as of pleasure are summoned up. Antici¬ pations will be either of hope or of fear, agreeably to the cast of mind and circumstances of the individual. In every case tranquillity will be changed into restlessnèss. Dante's notion that happiness consists in knowledge is beautiful and philosophical. But when we find that this know- ledge is the Aristotelian philosophy in a degraded state, or the miserable theology of the monks, or academical distinctions between moral and specu¬ lative virtue, our understandings are not much enlightened, and the conclusions we draw are not very suitable to the dignity of the subject.

Its politics, its personal allusions, andits religion, were subjects of general interest. The question of the independ- ence of Italy involved the happiness of every state; scarcely a great family but was praised or satirised in the poem, and every class of religionists found their opinions censured or commended. But Dante was not always intelligible to common readers. He had enriched the poetical language of his country, by introducing into it many forcible and beautiful words taken from the vari- ous vernacular idioms of Italy. He sometimes usedthem in their general acceptation; but often the difficulties of his subject compelled him to apply them in new significations, and those diffi¬ culties occasion the Divina Commedia to abound in poetical licences. From other causes Dante is an obscure writer. Bya single stroke of his pen he often draws a character; but he conceals the name of the person.

His father was a Flo¬ rentine of respectable family, but decayed for¬ tune, who suffered, like his friend, Dante, in the overthrow of the Whites; and, for some time after his banishment from Florence, dwelt at Arezzo. In this town of exile Francesco was born. He passed his youth at Incisa in the vale of Arno, at Pisa, and Leghorn; and in 1313 the family transported themselves to Avig- non, the common place of refuge of proscribed Italians. There, or in the village of Carpentras, four leagues distant from it, they continued for several years. The father and mother died about 1326, and Francesco and a brother were left with a very small patrimony. Petrarca had been designed for the profession of the law, and had complied with his father's wishes, in spending some years at Montpelier, and at that more famous seat of jurisprudence, Bologna. He did not come forth, however, a great civilian; and, except an occasional pleading or two for friends, forensic exertions form no part of his history.

In the course of the year 1333 he jour¬ neyed for eight months through midland northern France into the Low Countries, as far as Cologne. When he returned to the south, he found that the Colonna family were at Rome; and Petrarca, professing to detest the luxury and vice of Avignon, chose Vaucluse for his residence.

All his con¬ nections with the great and learned had in view the attainment of some popular testimonial of his merit. He was created a doctor in poetry; but his ambition was not satisfied, for his classical reading instructed him that in the Roman world poets and musicians were crowned till the days of Theodosius, when the Capitoline games were abolished, as forming part of the pagan super- stition. Petrarça at length succeeded in in¬ ducing the modern Romans to revivé the games of the capitol, and to crown him with laurel, the meed in ancient times of mighty poets.

The reflections which Petrarca made late in life upon the subject of his laureate crown are very curious. He thus writes to a friend : * Those laurels with which my brows were bound were too green.

She is so ethereal that there are not between her and Petrarca the expectations, and disappointments, the fond confidings, and painful misgivings of lovers. He wrote in the same strain the twentieth year of his phantasy as in the first; and, no wonder, for Petrarca knew Laura chiefly in his own mind. The vision dwelt there in such colours as his fancy created. He never spoke to her alone ; and he used to behold her only at church, or in general society. Laura's beauty, it seems, faded early. What though her hair had lost its golden lustre, and time had quenched the brilliancy of her eyes, Petrarca found comfort in the reflection that it was a religious spirit, a divine sun, which he adored.

The first proofs which Petrarca gave to the world of his sentiments towards Laura were sonnets. He wrote them in the Italian language, as every poet did who wished for general ap¬ plause. The world rang with commendations of his genius, and on that reputation he aspired to the laureate crown. Petrarca could not but continue his strains, for society still paid him its homage of praise, and praise was the life-blood of the poet. In every action he carefully sought the admiration of the world. When he thought the admiration of the world. When he thought proper to retire awhile from the gay scenes of life to his delightful solitary valley, he pro¬ claimed that he went thither to temper the ardour which devoured him amidst the shades of the woods, and in the cold waters of the mar- of the woods, and in the cold waters of the mar- vellous fountain of Vaucluse. The customary sonnet appeared : it was read and admired by the wits and beauties of Avignon; and the author, the wits and beauties of Avignon; and the author, adored by the ladies as the mirror of constancy, was in his retirement laughing at the good¬ natured credulity of the world, or writing his philosophical and moral works, most of which he tells us had either their commencement or he tells us had either their commencement or their completion at Vauclu se.

Petrarca makes frequent asseverations of his own virtue, and, like the Jewish prophets, he de¬ nounces woe to immoral cities ; but he is not always consistent in his hypocrisy. Thus, in his work, De Contemptu Mundi, written, as he says, with his usual affectation, in the sixteenth year of his passion, he confesses his love for Laura, and afterwards acknowledges that he has always found it impracticable to govern his licentious passions. This treatise was composed in the year 1343, five years before the death of Laura. (82) S 4                              "

Petrarca was fond of disclaiming all merit to his sonnets : he calls them mere juvenile exer¬ cises, mere sportive indulgencies of his wit and fancy, which he often intended to cast into the fire. This renunciation of honor must however be placed among the artifices of literary men. He says in one of his sonnets, that if he had anticipated the applause which his Italian poetry had met with, he would have written it with more care. S’ io avessi pensato, che si care Fosser le voci de' sospir miei in rima, Fatte l'avrei dal sospirar mio prima In numero più spesse, in stil più rare But it is certain that Petrarca did use all pos¬ sible diligence ; that he did give all the powers of his mind to the revision of his sonnets and can¬ of his mind to the revision of his sonnets and can¬ zonieri. Some of his own manuscripts are yet in being. In them the poet has marked the various corrections which he made in any particular verse, and the year, the day, and the hour when each successive change was made. These manu- scripts destroy the supposition that he did not rest any of his hopes of fame on his Italian poetry. Besides, Petrarca in his old age solicited his friend, Coluccio Salutati, to correct his works, his friend, Coluccio Salutati, to correct his works,                            "

Petrarca had so much of the irrita¬ bility of genius, that it was impossible for him to pass over with indifference any of his literary productions. He wrote some wretched eclogues in imitation of Virgil; and was deeply mortified that they weré censured by his judicious friends. If he had been dead to fame on the subject of his sonnets, why was he jealous of Dante's great poem in the vernacular idiom ? The existence of that jealousy is evident from his cold and sneering letter to Boccaccio, when that honest son of genius, not observing in Petrarca’s library a copy of the Divina Commedia, made one with a copy of the Divina Commedia, made one with his own hand, and sent it to his friend, with a his own hand, and sent it to his friend, with a letter, in which he acknowledges that Dante's mind had first illuminated his own. Why, when Petrarça mentions the poet of the invisible world is it always in company with, and in no higher terms of eulogium than he bestows upon, the wretched versifiers who lived in the first ages of Italian poetry? The worst sonnets of Petrarça are full of extravagancies of opinion, and conceits in lan¬ guage.

Petrarca's genius was so much superior to that of his precursors in the gay science, that it gave brilliancy and pathos to their lifeless forms. His excellent sonnets, and they are so many that I cannot particularize them, though not pictures of a heart torn by passion, are rich, fanciful, and elegant : at least, as much so as can be expected in that Procrustes of poetry, the sonnet. The Graces are very deco¬ rously dressed in the verses of Petrarca. The perfect chasteness of his muse is astonishing, when we read the licentious ravings of the Trou¬ badours. The Provençal bards, like the poet of Vaucluse were mystics in love. But nature forced her way through their Platonism. It is difficult to suppose, considering the amatory character of Petrarca, that if his feelings for Laura had been those of ardent love, some cor¬ responding expression would not have escaped him. The Canzoni of Petrarca, on moral and political subjects, have often ideas astonishingly noble, conveyed in expressions of majestic gra¬ vity. Lyrical poetry has not many finer pieces than his canzoni beginning with the words,O aspettata in ciel,\" and, * Sprito gentil, che quelle membra reggi,\" in the former of which he endea- vours to revive the spirit of crusading ; and in                              "

Petrarca's lyrical genius appears in full display in several others of the canzoni, particularly in those whose initial lines are « Chiare fresche e dolci acque, «Di pensier in pensier, di monti in monti,\" * In¬ quella parte dove amor mi sprona ;' and “ Nella stagion che ’l ciel rapido inchina.\" His Trionfi of death, chastity, &amp;c. are, forthe most part, dull and death, chastity, & are, forthe most part, dull and frigid allegories, seldom illuminated by therays of poetic fancy, or made interesting by the glow of poetic feeling. Petrarca, like Dante, owes much of his celebrity to the circumstance that he was one of the earliest writers of genius in the Italian language. To him, as a man who contributed to the perfection of this most melodious dialect; posterity bow with veneration; for the purity, taste and melodiousness of his verses are beyond all praise. But he has a still nobler title to fame; for he was one of those illustrious few who aroused the world from their long slumber of ignorance; and with some remarks upon that subject I shall conclude my account of Petrarca. His mind was so much more elegant than the prevailing tone of intellect, that it took its chief delight in studying the historians, the philoso¬ phers, and the poets of the classical world. He "

He was in constant correspond¬ ence with the most distinguished personages of his time, on the subject of the high advantages of his time, on the subject of the high advantages which the world would enjoy if the monkish philosophy should give place to classical litera¬ ture. Through many an essay and epistle, his wish is breathed in sententious brevity or glowing eloquence that the authority of Virgil and Cicero should triumph over the fame of Aristotle and his Arabian commentators. He searched for, and transcribed, manuscripts of ancient authors, and was the earliest scholar who thought that much light could be thrown upon ancient history, if complete collections were to be formed of clas¬ sical medals. He says that it is impossible, nor would he wish, to destroy his desire of restoring the literary glories of Greece and Rome. He diligently studied such fragments as were then known of Statius, Ovid, and Claudian. He dis¬ covered part of Varro and Quinctilian. But Cicero was his idol. Petrarca never could speak of him except in language of deep and enthu¬ of him except in language of deep and enthu¬ siastic veneration.

When he was young, he studied Virgil and Cicero instead of the dry and dismal books that generally formed the reading of youth. His father accidentally discovered him in the midst of his unauthorized occupation, and in the first moments of his anger he would have cast the classics into the fire; but the tears and prayers of the vouth restrained him. Petrarca diligently, but in vain, endeavoured to recover such of Cicero's in vain, endeavoured to recover such of Cicero's works as were not then known. The celebrated treatise. De Gloria, was once in his possession; but he lent it to an old friend, who pledged it for aloan of money, and Petrarca never recovered the book. Petrarca's Latin style is pure and elegant. The beauty of the language is the great merit of his numerous prose works, on philosophy, geo¬ graphy, or history. It is amazing that a man who was so far above his age as to despise the barbarous Latin of the monks, had not the same sympathy with the good sense of the ancients as he had with their elegance. It is more surprising, he had with their elegance. It is more surprising, when we consider that he frequently ridicules the alchymical and astrological studies of his contemporaries.

Petrarca, from his admiration of Virgil, resolved to write an epic poem. He took Scipio Africa¬ to write an epic poem. He took Scipio Africa¬ nus for his hero, and entitled his poem “ Africa.' In collocation of words it has the merit of being classic; but it has no antique simplicity of taste, and is indeed a history in verse instead of being an epopee. Late in life Petrarca entertained the same opinion of his “ Africa\" as that which poste- rity has expressed: he could not bear that his friends should converse before him upon the sub¬ ject; he did every thing within his ability to sup- press such copies as were in circulation, and it was with great difficulty that after his death his old li¬ terary associates, Boccaccio and Coluccio Salutati, could obtain a complete copy of it from his heirs. It was not until after his coronation in the capital that Petrarca attempted to add a knowledge of Grecian literature to his other literary acquisitions. The Greek language very rarely formed a branch of education in the early part of the fourteenth century. In the year 1342, Petrarca met at Avignon a Calabrian monk named Barlaam, the ambassador of the Greek emperor to Pope Benedict XII. Petrarca, whose mind was always thirsting after knowledge, learnt from Barlaam the rudiments of the language,                              "

His father was, as a merchant, sufficiently rich to preserve his son from the usual infelicities of literary men. Indeed, in consequence of the respectability of his family, Giovanni was often employed by the signiory of Florence on foreign embassies. But sometimes the expences of plea¬ sure and of literature exceeded his revenue. Petrarca was the only friend who adhered to him through all seasons.

Neither did this proposal suit. Petrarca's reply is simple and noble. I praise you,\" he says, addressing himself to Boccaccio, “ for having refused the great riches which I have offered you, and for preferring liberty of mind and a state of life of tranquillity and poverty; but I do not com¬ mend you for refusing what a friend— and you have often called me so—has since proposed.

He was cri¬ minally attached to an illegitimate daughter of Robert, King of Naples, who was married to a Neapolitan nobleman. For her he wrote his romances of Filocopo and Fiammetta, and his poems called the Theseida and the Filostrato. The reputation of these poems was so high, that the English poet Chaucer has founded one of his most celebrated tales, that of Palamon and Arcite on the former, and his Troilus on and Arcite on the former, and his Troilus on the latter. Chaucer has shown great taste in rejecting the superfluities, and improving the general arrangement of both stories. He has abridged the Italian poet's pedantic display of ancient history and mythology, and has given an air of nature and life to many situations and circumstances of the characters which Boccaccio made cold and unaffecting. (84) Petrarca, the private friend as well as the literary companion of Boccaccio, in no case proved his regard more affectionately than in his constant endeavours, by writing and con¬ versation, to turn him from profligacy. His counsels were without effect; and they certainly lost much of their natural force, from being unsupported by any good example in the author.                              "

Petrarça counselled his friend, who was terrified into virtue, to adhere to his resolution of reform¬ ing his manners, but to regard the story as an in- stance of priestcraft, and not to be diverted from his usual literary studies. Boccaccio's enthu¬ siasm did not, however, accord with this wise and pious counsel. He who had incessantly written against the corruptions of the monastic orders, now strangely thought that virtue could dwell under a cowl. He became an ecclesias¬ tic; and the circumstance of his illegitimacy was easily dispensed with by the Pope.

But when he read the canzoni of Petrarca, he threw he read the canzoni of Petrarca, he threw his own lyrical pieces into the fire. He pre¬ served his poems of the Theseida and Filostrato. His ambition then aspired to excellence in prose; and accordingly the Decamerone ap¬ peared, which soon was considered as much the standard of one mode of writing as the Divina Commedia was of the other. Part of it was published in 1353, the remainder some years afterwards.  On other accounts Boccaccio was regarded as a great beaçon in the intellectual darkness of the fourteenth century. Not only, as I have already said, was he a diligent gatherer of classical ma¬ nuscripts, but his labours in transcription far exceeded those of any hired copyist. He has the honour of being one of the first Europeans who endeavoured to revive the study of Greek letters in the West. In his work De Genealogia Deorum, he rejoices, with commendable pride, that he had recalled Homer and other ancient sages into Tuscany.

During his residence in his youth at Naples he had learnt something of the Greek tongue, for a corruption of it formed a part of the vernacular idiom of Magna Græcia. But it does not appear that he studied it grammati¬ it does not appear that he studied it grammati¬ cally. Petrarca, as we have already seen, learnt but little Greek from Leontius Pilatus. He introduced, however, the Calabrian to Boccac- cio; and this introduction is a most interesting circumstance in the history of literature, for Boccaccio was immediately inflamed by the noble ambition of reviving Greek literature in the West; and at his solicitation the Florentine the West; and at his solicitation the Florentine state created a professorship of Greek, the earliest one that was established in Europe. This circumstance occurred about the year 1360. Boccaccio conducted the Calabrian in triumph to Florence, and lodged him in his own house. They lived together for three years; and so strong was Boccaccio's zeal for letters, that he disregarded the inconveniences of enter¬ taining as his mensal companion a man filthy in person, morose in manners, and pedantic in speech.

He often mistook the author's meaning. He read Homer and much of Plato with Pilatus ; but he conjectured the sense, instead of discovering it by grammatical analysis. Although his own individual scholarship was imperfect, his example diffused a taste for Greek literature. In con¬ sequence, however, of the extreme rarity of Greek books, curiosity gradually died away. Nor did he confer inferior benefits on Italian than on Greek literature. Boccaccio always considered Dante as the first of modern poets; and it was his unceasing care to inspire the Florentines with a liberal admiration of their illustrious citizen. At length Florence decreed the foundation of a professorship, in honor of the man whom the same city not a century before the man whom the same city not a century before had condemned to be burnt alive. Boccaccio was fixed upon as the interpreter of La Divina Commedia. He performed the office for a few months; but he was then in the last stage of life ; and his lectures extend only, as already mentioned, to the sixteenth canto of the Inferno. He wrote the life of the subject the Inferno. He wrote the life of the subject of his commentaries. There are some elegant 8                              "

But the work will disappoint a reader who turns to it with anxiety to know what one great man has said of another. There is more of romance than history in the book. Boccaccio spent the last years of his life at Certaldo. In that delightful retreat he composed his works, De Genealogia Deorum; De Montibus Sylvis, &amp;c.; De casibus virorum et foeminarum Sylvis, & De casibus virorum et foeminarum illustrium; and De claris mulieribus. Much of the book De Genealogia Deorum, is avowedly taken from awork called the Collectivum, written by Paulus Perusinus, a contemporary of Boccac¬ cio. Perusinus was librarian to Robert, king of Jerusalem and Sicily, and is described by Boccaccio as collecting Greek history and poetry from Barlaam and other Greeks. But upon the whole, considering the great difficulty of the whole, considering the great difficulty of acquiring classical literature in the fourteenth century, the work on mythology does Boccaccio honour. It held its ground as a book of study for many years, and, indeed, until the philologists and gramarians of Italy had cleared the avenues to the temples of classical literature. Boccaccio's other works are neither interesting nor curious. The biographical notices are faint sketches, and "

I made an excursion to the last retreat of Boccaccio, with the feelings of a pilgrim to classic ground. The simple house is perfectly in the state in which Boccaccio left it.

Boccaccio died at the close of the year 1374, few months after the death of his friend a Petrarca, and was buried in the church of St. Jacopo and Filippo, at Certaldo. In his epitaph, written by himself, it is curious to observe, that he mentions poetry as if it had been the only sub¬ he mentions poetry as if it had been the only sub¬ ject of his genius.

He certainly was the earliest Italian poet who used that beautiful form of verse, the ottava rima. Not that he was the inventor of it : for in a rude form it existed among the Sicilian poets; and is even to be met with in the poems of the Troubadours. He used the ottava rima in his early poems of the Theseida and the Filostrato. There is another circumstance in these poems interesting to the history of poetry. Before Boccaccio's time, poets were accustomed to make visions and dreams the vehicles of their tales. Boccaccio boldly imitated the classical poets, imagined à fable, and conducted it, by various events, to the close. Thie language of these poems is very the close. Thie language of these poems is very pure. Boccaccio also has the merit of being the inventor of pastorals containing a mixture ot prose and poetry; a species of composition which has been highly in favour with the Italians. It is, however, as the father of Italian prose, It is, however, as the father of Italian prose, that Boccaccio stands pre-eminent. He gave it richness, purity, and harmony. Whether such was his wish'or not, his fame rests on his novels, and of those, on the Decamerone chiefly.

Towards the close of his life, he cer¬ his work. Towards the close of his life, he cer¬ tainly regretted that so much licentiousness had fallen from his pen; and this opinion gave rise, perhaps, to the assertion which Ihave mentioned. Of the Decamerone I must say a few words. Boccaccio supposes, that during the dreadful pestilence which raged through Europe in the fourteenth century, and which devastated the rich and populous city of Florence, in the year 1848. seven young ladies and three gentlemen retired to a beautiful house and garden, a short distance from the city, and diverted the time by telling tales. Each person told one tale a day. Ten days formed the time of the continuance of the party, and, therefore, the compound word Deca- merone is given to the budget of stories. It is an amusing proof Boccaccio's fondness for Greek literature, that he has given a Greek title Greek literature, that he has given a Greek title to his book, and Greek names to the ladies and to his book, and Greek names to the ladies and gentlemen who recite the tales. To assemble several persons, whose object it is to narrate tales, is a common artifice in Oriental literature, and was well known in Europe in Boccaccio's time, by French and Latin translations of a collection                              "

Chaucer has adopted the fashion which the popu¬ larity of Boccaccio gave rise to, of investing tales in a dramatic form: but he has infinitely improved on his original, by collecting a number of pilgrims, who agreed to deceive the road, by telling tales. Each person speaks agreeably to his character and circumstances; and the judi¬ cious appropriation of stories to individuals is a great subject for the exercise of the author's ingenuity. The want of this harmony makes Boccaccio’s machinery occasionally appear cum¬ brous. Besides, as pilgrimages were often made excursions of pleasure as well as of religion, the telling of tales was a natural part of the enter¬ tainment, much more conformable to situation than amusement of that sort in the midst of a public calamity. Few of the tales in the Decamerone are the perfect creations of Boccaccio's genius. Most of them existed already in a rude shape. The col¬ lection of tales called the Gesta Romanorum, by Peter Berchorius, prior of the Benedictine con¬ vent of St. Eloy at Paris, was a very favorite work in the fourteenth century, when it was written, as well as in after times. Boccaccio has occasionally                              "

Hence many Oriental and Greek fictions are to be met with in the Decamerone. Boccaccio likewise borrowed from the Trouveurs of the north and the Troubadours of the south of France. Italian cities were in Boccaccio's time so much infested by vagrant French minstrels, that their excesses were made the subject of municipal regulation. Some germs of the Deca¬ merone are to be found in the Golden Ass of Apuleius, in the tales of the Seven Wise Men, and others in the collection of popular stories called the Cento Novelle Antiche. Many had been long the hereditary property of the travel¬ ling Italian minstrels, and not a few were mere village stories. The proud lord, the polite cava¬ lier, the lovely damsel, the cruel and avaricious father, coquettes, and cuckolds, luxurious monks, and crafty friars, were common members of society in Boccaccio's time, and he has intro¬ duced them into his tales in every possible variety of exhibition.

There is unhappily much in the Decamerone that offends delicacy ; and yet the poems were written for the amusement of the ladies, per cacciar la malinconia delle femine, as the author says. It has been well and pointedly remarked, that Boccaccio has been less scrupulous in vio¬ lating the laws of morals, which we receive from God, than in shocking the rules that regulate the purity of language, and which proceed only from the will and caprice of men. Some pass- ages have even been construed into a contempt of religion.

Indeed the profligacy of the monastic orders. Indeed whenever any act of peculiar sensuality and atrocity is to be performed, a monk is the actor. It was surmised that his laughter at false relics proceeded from a secret contempt for religion.

The young and the gay read it for its scenes of pleasure ; the man of the world admired its lively pictures of human nature; and the scholar found in it the treasures of Italian prose.

The first fruit of his labour, as the earliest glimmer of day, was the distinction of the five Orders of day, was the distinction of the five Orders among the ancients, a distinction so essential to the art, that it is better to preserve it in all its rigour at the risque of monotony, than to mix the Orders, and run into the danger of plunging the art into its former state of barbaric confusion. Brunelleschi built the church of St. Lorenzo at Florence, the first modern edifice that was raised on Grecian principles of architecture. He crowned the cathedral or church of Santa Maria del Fiore with the octagonal cupola, which even Michelangiolo himself could never regard without admiration. The history of the edifice is recorded in the inscription : Tal sopra sasso Di giro in giro eternamente io strussi, Che cosi passo Alto girando al ceil mi ricondussi. Brunelleschi'sideas were so much superior to those of his age, that his plans were ridiculed by the artists who met together at Florence, from every part of Europe, upon the subject of the cupola.

When Chrysoloras commenced his course of Greek lectures at Florence, a want of Greek books was soon experienced. Palla Strozzi immediately sent money to Greece that the necessary manuscripts might be purchased. Copies of Plato, Plutarch, and other authors, were soon returned to Florence. Aristotle's politics were likewise brought, and from that transcript after having served for the lectures of Chrysoloras, Lionardo Bruni of Arezzo, whom I shall presently mention, made his translation.

The dis¬ position of his mind to letters was early inflamed by the circumstance, that in a room in which he was once confined, a portrait of Petrarca was always before his eyes. He studied Latin under Giovanni of Ravenna, a pupil of Petrarca, and whose school, kept in different towns, was the most celebrated one in Italy, at the close of the fourteenth and commencement of the fifteenth centuries. He acquired both the rudiments and the elegancies of Greek from Emanuel Chry- soloras.

His manners were as much loved as his learning was respected. His courtesy was always guided by moral principle.

The conduct of Lionardo will appear in great lustre when contrasted with that of the generally correct Ambrogio Traver¬ sari. That man of letters wrote to Niccoli, re¬ questing him to present his regards to the most faithful Benvenuta. Lionardo's principles of rectitude influenced him in the most trying cases. His personal pride gave way to the noblest sentiments of honor.

But Lorenzo could write, as well as judge of, books. He may be considered, indeed, as one of the restorers of Italian verse. The poets of Italy, whether from poverty of genius, despair of excellence, or the too powerful influence of classical literature, had seldom sung in the vernacular idiom since the laureate fraternity of the fourteenth century. Lorenzo's amatory strains, like those of Petrarca, spring more from the imagination than the heart. He did not always desire an object of his own passion to describe in the language of love, for the deceased mistress of his brother Giuliano, was the first subject of his verse. The young lady had, indeed, been generally loved, and her death was mourned by all the Florentine youth. Lorenzo says, that while all the wit and eloquence of Florence were exerted in honouring her memory, he vielded to the general fashion, and in order he vielded to the general fashion, and in order to give the appearance of reality to his sonnets, to give the appearance of reality to his sonnets, Y 3                               "

Lorenzo's eye surveyed with anxious curiosity the persons and manners of the Flo¬ rentine ladies : but so many perfections did his fancy combine in the Laura of his imagination, and so often did he find in life the mixture of defects and merits, that he could not easily dis¬ cover the object of his search. At last, however, a young lady appeared of such surpassing grace, a young lady appeared of such surpassing grace, that he considered the fair one who had died, only as the star Venus, which at the approach of the sun is dim and eclipsed.

He poetically substi¬ tuted this name for the name of his family, and called himself Poliziano instead of Ambrogini.

In painting the occu¬ pations and amusements of Giuliano's youth, it shows all the freshness and fertility of a young imagination, and the vigorous intellect of learned maturity. In describing the enchanted isle of Cyprus and the palace of Venus, Poliziano has poured forth all the riches of poetical fancy; and it is curious to trace in that description the first model of Ariosto's celebrated : Isle of Alcina.\" Poliziano gave the ottava rima, in¬ vented by Boccaccio, a harmony and a round¬ ness which not even the songster of Orlando Furioso could improve.

But it does not appear that Michelangiolo ever painted in oil him¬ self. He said, indeed, that oil painting was an art fit only for women and idlers; but that expression must not be understood fully and absolutely, and without re- gard to the circumstances that gave birth to it. Pope Paul III., at the advice of Sebastiano del Piombo changed his original intention that the Last Judgment should be executed in fresco, and commanded that it should be performed in oil colours. Michelangiolo was indig¬ nant at this interference of his friend Piombo, and knew also that fresco painting was alone suitable to his subject, and consistent with the rest of the chapel. Not that he thought meanly of oil painting when em- ployed in proper places, for he admired the colouring of Tiziano, and of several other artists who used that of Tiziano, and of several other artists who used that material.

The plans of Michelangiolo were generally acted upon by succeeding Popes, but the work on the whole lan¬ guished for want of money till the days of Sixtus V.

For the completion of the formidable cupola, he named as architects, Dominico Fontana, and, Jacopo della Porta, the latter of whom had been a pupil of Jacopo Barrozzio, who for some years had conducted the works. With the permission of the Pontiff, the new architects altered Michelangiolo's plan by making it more elliptical, thinking that form of the cupola would be more graceful. Some change in the lanthorn intended to surmount the cupola was necessarily projected. The execution of the new plan was com¬ menced on the 15th July, 1588. Six hundred workmen, animated by the exhortations and blessings of the Pope, laboured day and night, and the undertaking was so quickly completed, that the last stone, blessed by the Pontiff after a solemn mass, was laid on the 14th May, 1590., amidst a discharge of artillery from the castle of St. Angelo. Ten years instead of only twenty- two months ought to have been employed in this work. The evils of this precipitation have been found in some subsequent examinations of the cupola. Urban VII. was the reigning pontiff at the time of the completion; Sixtus had died some months before. The lanthorn was raised by Vignola. The portico was not yet executed; nor had Michelangiolo thought of the sacristy, and many other usual parts of Christian temples. An alter- ation of the established plans was, therefore, nécessary, and unluckily for St. Peter's and the arts, Pope Paul and unluckily for St. Peter's and the arts, Pope Paul IV. approved of the alterations, which one Carlo Ma¬ derno proposed: a more miserable artist never lived in short-lived popularity. He changed the Greek cross that Michelangiolo had designed, into a Latin one, agreeably to the first intention of Bramante; he made the dark and narrow aisles, the wretched front, and, the dark and narrow aisles, the wretched front, and, indeed, committed almost all the absurdities that                                    "

Trusting his judgment to that of the masons, who examined the foundations of the portico, and who reported that they were sound and firm, Bernini began to raise a cupola on the south-east angle: but the walls of the portico soon tottered under the new weight, and the plans of the artist were defeated. the new weight, and the plans of the artist were defeated. Pope Urban VIII. died before Bernini could re¬ cover his fame. Innocent X. appointed commissioners to examine the state of the portico and the belfry, and they discovered that the portico had been raised upon earth and rubbish which were continually loosened by water. The consequence was that the belfry was taken down; an hundred thousand Roman crowns (more than 20,000l. sterling) had been expended in the raising of it; the destruction of the work cost twelve thousand the destruction of the work cost twelve thousand Thère would have been no necessity for a belfry, if the plan of Michelangiolo had been persevered in, but such an ornament is necessary to relieve the monotony of the front.

He caused some event in sacred to the modern Oratorio. He caused some event in sacred history to be put into verse, and set to music by the best poets and performers of his time. He divided the drama into two parts; one part was sung before, and the other after the sermon; the interest of the auditors the other after the sermon; the interest of the auditors was excited by the commencement, and Neri's object was effected, of inducing people to remain during the sermon. A true oratorio is a mystery or morality in music, except that the part which used to be spoken is delivered in musical recitation. The first sacred drama or oratorio in which recitative was used, was called or oratorio in which recitative was used, was called L'anima e corpo, and was performed in the oratory of the church of Santa Maria della Vallicella at Rome, in the year 1600. The recitativo or musica parlante was the mode in which the Greeks and Romans performed the mode in which the Greeks and Romans performed their dramas.
