This exactly true: they seem to be but half-finished ; and in most parts so faintly portrayed, that you can¬ not conceive why nature persevères in striking off more copies of them. Where- ever the strokes are deep and strong, you may be sure there is a blot. The Romans are a sullen, pale, spiritless, morose people. They hardly ever speak, except to beg alms, which when offered they absolutely tear from the giver, with¬ out taking the trouble to thank him for them, and without showing the least satis- faction at having obtained them. They are not at all like the Italians we had pre- viously seen ; in fact, they are like no other living beings. The whole nation seems tired of its existence, and waiting for the sleep of death. Walking, seeing, hearing,—every act in short seems to be a painful exertion of exhausted mind and body. I never saw one of them smile.—1 am now speaking of the native Romans of the lower classes, not the native Romans of the lower classes, not of the temporary inhabitants of Rome, who of the temporary inhabitants of Rome, who come from various districts far and near, to gain their livelihood in the city ; nor am                            "

The latter, whose appearance is classical, graceful and picturesque, do seem to have some life and spirit remain¬ ing. How different, alas! from the me¬ lancholy citizens of Rome! Yet is there something in the sulky inso- lence of the Romans,—in their morose, ill¬ natured looks,—that puts one strongly in mind of what they were in the days of their prosperity. Their manner is like the growl- ing of an old mastiff, conscious at once of his former strength, and of the loss of his teeth. It is this galling sense of their im¬ potence which makes them such dangerous enemies ; they brood over their injuries with a degree of malice of which they would not be capable, if they thought they could éasily revenge them; and as they are pos- sessed of few ideas, that one passion which happens to take full possession of their minds festers sooner or later into a crime. The following remarkable occurrence, which was reported to have recently taken place, will serve to illustrate what Ihavesaid. B2                             "

Two men were proceeding to the last ex¬ tremity in a quarrel, and one of them would undoubtedly have perished in the broil, if they had not been parted by a barber, who was perhaps a mutual friend of both of them. He went home, well pleased with the success of his interference, and never doubting that he had conciliated to himself the good-will of both parties. In the evening he had shut up his shop at the usual hour, and was retiring, when he heard some one calling his name from he heard some one calling his name from the street. Looking through a wicket to see who it could be, he received at the instant a blow from a hatchet, which cut through his collar and his neckcloth, and penetrated into his neck, so as very nearly to despatch him on the spot! But though he was thought to be past all cure, he nevertheless recovered ; and, recovering, vowed vengeance in his turn on the person who had perpetrated this on the person who had perpetrated this deed, and whom he had clearly recog¬ nised as one of the two men whom he had parted. But the assin had fled to a parted. But the assassin had fled to a church, where he staid till some Cardinal                            "

The latter, however, told an acquaintance of mine, from whom I had the anecdote, that he had made a mental reservation in signing the instru¬ ment; and that he was firmly determined to perfect his revenge, though he had to wait fifty years for a fit opportunity! There is less to be said about the classes which stand immediately above the lowest : the tradespeople are, in general, honest and civil, far from cheerful, but yet not sullen. An active life is, undoubtedly, the best of all remedies against moral, as well as phy¬ sical disorders; and this class affords a clear proof the truth of this remark; for there is no other way of accounting for the very striking difference in character, be¬ tween them and the poorer classes. As to the higher ranks, they are in all countries so very nearly alike, that 1 had little expectation of finding them marked with any distinguishing features in Rome; but I was mistaken : they are remarkable for                            "

There are some few exceptions, but those few are almost exclusively among the de¬ scendants of mothers who were not natives of Rome. Such as they are, the Romans are as sus¬ ceptible of the grossest flattery as the most warlike nations of modern Europe; and their dramatic authors cram them with the same nauseous food that the British shilling gallery, and the French paradis have so long been used to. I saw an opera called Quinto Fabio, in which the words “ Roma invincibile sempre sarà\" were always encored with the most lively enthusiasm, and with such shouts that I could hardly believe my¬ self to be in a Roman theatre. One of the most ridiculous specimens of bombast which l'ever read, was a Roman account of a concert given by Catalani.

But bright contrasts are to be found to all that is absurd and unamiable in the general character of the lower classes at Rome. met one day, in a walk on the Palatine Hill, (which I preferred to any other part of ancient Rome,) a young labourer, who offered me a piece of rosso antico. As I had no small coin about me, I told him I could not take it from him; but he persisted in pressing it upon me, saying that it could not be worth more than a baiocco to me, and was of no manner of use to him. Tac¬ cordingly took it, and some time afterwards having met the man again, I offered him half a paolo; he declared that he would not accept of more than a baiocco, and if I did not happen to have one, he would take no¬ thing at all.

I asked him if he would like to see that town. He replied, that his father would not let him go, and that he himself being accustomed to work from morning to night, did not care to go gadding about the world for the sake of gaining more than he wanted for the com¬ mon necessaries of life. In my next walk on the Palatine (with Mr. Campbell, Lord Succoth's son,) we met the young man's father, an old peasant from Rimini, who was employed by the same gardener in driving a cart with vegetables to the mar¬ ket, and 1 asked him if he would suffer his son to accompany me to Naples and back. * Would you have me die, said the old man, with an expression of reproach in his countenance and his voice.

These were Italians, and I wish some traits like this were introduced into those novels which treat their countrymen so ill. It would be an interesting pursuit to set on foot a regular series of observations and on foot a regular series of observations and inquiries upon the causes which make the Italians sometimes so nobly good, and some times so atrociously bad. It is a common remark, that opposite extremes approach each other; but the reason that they do so in this instance is more difficult to divine than in any other. I wish some one of our great philosophers would take up this question, and treat it with all the attention it de- serves. Perhaps a principal cause of cruelty may be traced to original timidity ; as we often see that cowards, who have once been obliged to fight, become thenceforward the most quarrelsome of men.

A commission was promised him in the Pope's body-guards; but as the officers unanimously declared that they would not serve with him, this arrangement could not be carried into effect. While, however, the negotia¬ tion was on foot, the Dieci Nove lived in Rome, and affected to frequent all the pub¬ lick places; he walked about with his mis¬ tresses, and dressed in a splendid and costly manner, wearing in particular very beauti¬ ful diamond rings, the spoils no doubt of his unfortunate victims. Every body shun¬ ned him, but no one durst affront him. The Freemasons being at that time peculiarly odious to the Government, he one day en¬ tered the Ruspoli coffee-house, uttering the most horrible threats against them, saying he would like to see one face to face. A young Spanish colonel, who was sitting at the other end of the room, came up to the ruf¬ fian, took his seat by him, and told him that he was a Freemason.

Sometime afterwards, not being able to obtain the conditions he required, he again left Rome, and retired into the mountains, where he resumed the com¬ mand of his former, or of some other band of murderers. This same Ruspoli coffee-house, which is the largest in Rome, was the scene of a more tragical event, much about the same time. A man came in, while there were more than fifty persons assembled there, stabbed one of the guests, staid a moment, while all the company remained petrified with astonishment and horror, and walked out quietly, without being pursued by any out quietly, without being pursued by any one; nay, he staid several days in Rome, and at length only fled to Naples, on hear¬ ing that measures were about to be taken for his arrest.

CARDINAL Pacca, the present Gover¬ nor of Rome, is a very clever, active, and I believe a well-meaning Minister. He has done a great deal of good, and may live to do much more; for he is still young and healthy.

The road, thus far, is rendered highly interesting by many fine remains of aqueducts, sepulchral monuments, and other architectural ruins.

Near that place is an artificial hillock, or tumulus, which I should call an Asiatick tomb, of which I have seen many hundreds in the south of Russia. It is surprising in the south of Russia.

We found the number of beggars comparatively small; but the majority of the poor in these parts are doubtless attracted to Rome, by the notion that so large a town must afford them a better chance of relief. The next day, Friday, 7th March, we left Velletri very early in the morning, and crossing the Pontine Marshes, pushed on without stopping until we reached Mola di Gaeta ; but not without admiring on our way the beautiful situation of Terracina, and the magnificent prospect of the Gulf of Gaeta. The difference is very striking be¬ tween the Roman and the Neapolitan pos- tillions and horses ; and the comparison is far from being favourable to the latter. The Neapolitan postillions do their utmost to cheat you, and if they find you too wary to cheat you, and if they find you too wary for them they grow exceedingly insolent. In this respect, they are, I think even worse than the postillions of Germany; but a de¬ E 2                             "

Two beds were shewn to us, one of which was much too small, and both stood in the same filthy apartment, all the windows of which were broken. For this accommoda¬ tion the host had the impudence to demand two dollars: but as we thought it was quite enough to have paid that amount already for a most wretched dinner, we determined, after resting there for an hour or two, to tra- vel all night.

You begin to perceive an extraordinary degree of vivacity in the whole population, long ere you arrive at the Capital ; and this appearance increases so strikingly at every mile, that you are well prepared for the astonishing scene which awaits you on entering the city. One of the circumstances which surprised me most was the immense multitude of very young children, who are already of use to their parents. You see little boys and girls of five or six years old, as busily employed as their elders; one is the bearer of his father's breakfast to the fields ; another carries a pick-axe or a spade, which you would hardly think him strong enough to lift; another is driving an ass with vegetables to market. We saw a little creature stand- ing on a chair grinding a knife, while ano- ing on a chair grinding a knife, while ano- ther still younger was turning the wheel.

Ifyou still refuse to give them any thing, they re- commence howling in the most fatiguing manner, and never leave you until they have gained their end. It is therefore expedient for a stranger to be well provided with small coins for these occasions, whenever he stirs abroad. They do not usually apply he stirs abroad. They do not usually apply to persons on foot, but prefer attacking those who drive in carriages, whom they pursue with the most indefatigable perse¬ verance. But it is in the coffee-houses and the shops that the beggars of Naples are most disagreeable. The moment you give any thing to one of them, you are besieged by a dozen ; and it is almost impossible to get a dozen ; and it is almost impossible to get rid of them.

The Neapolitans are without exception the most sensual people in Europe, of which their climate is undoubtedly the predispos¬ ing cause. But the punishment of sensu¬ ality has here followed close upon its indul¬ gence; and the disgusting traces of that punishment are visible at every step, to warn and deter from this degrading vice.

Some of these establishments are very good, and others elegant ; but the most comfortable house of the sort, to my taste, is that called the City of Sienna, opposite the theatre of San Carlo, which is fitted up with small boxes, like the London coffee- houses.

The prima Donna, the Signora Colbran, sometimes sung out of tune from the beginning to the end of the opera; but as she was a great friend of the manager's, she sung and dressed as she pleased with perfect impunity.

Madame Murat's apartment answers ex¬ actly to the idea that people had of her; particularly her bathing closet. She was more respected, but much more disliked more respected, but much more disliked than her husband ; for she was tyrannical in her whims, and whatever she had set her mind upon, could not be refused her without danger.

Grieved at the reflection, that it would be separated and dispersed after his death, and that the fruits of his long his death, and that the fruits of his long and painful labours would be lost to the scientifick world, he proposed to Murat to sell his collection to the State for a very moderate sum, much below its real value,                             "

The bargain was concluded; but unfortunately Ma¬ dame Murat saw the medals ; and as they were chiefly of gold and silver, they pleased her so exceedingly, that she declared she was determined to have them for her pri¬ vate amusement.

The busts, as well as the pedestrian and equestrian sta¬ tues of the Roman emperors, are extremely fine. The Farnese Hercules is accounted one of the wonders of ancient sculpture, by those who are able to judge of its merit. Thave already confessed, elsewhere, that 1 am not one of the number. Accord¬ ing to my system there must be not only relative but positive beauty in any statue which is to inspire me with enthusiasm. That of Aristides pleases me a thousand times better, because it is real nature ; and I could have looked at it for days and nights, without moving from the spot. Venus Callipyga is known to be the handsomest of all the statues of that goddess, after the of all the statues of that goddess, after the Venus de' Medici ; but Icannot say that I admire it in every part. The bosom seems to have been copied from that of a mother and a nurse ; and though Venus certainly and a nurse ; and though Venus certainly was a mother, I think she ought, as a goddess, to have been allowed a patent by courtesy for the preservation of her charms.

Two of the Muses, Calliope and Poly¬ hymnia, are magnificent pieces ; so is the Flora: and two statues on horseback, which adorned the theatre of Herculaneum, are to be numbered among the master-pieces of antiquity. There is also, an amazingly fine bronze bust of Antinoùs crowned with vine, like Bacchus. It is to be regretted that one of-the best things in the Studio is a group which, for reasons that have nothing to do with the perfection of the work, cannot be de¬ scribed : it is usually, and very properly, veiled, though it may be doubted whether this very circumstance does not produce an effect the reverse of what is intended. Some of the most ancient statues which were brought from Pæstum, are very like the Agina Marbles, of which I gave a par¬ ticular description in speaking of Rome: others are like them in some véry peculiar VOL.

These coincidences can¬ not, however, be confidently applied to an investigation of the æra to which the temples of either place may be traced ; for the statues which were discovered at Pæs¬ tum, may have been brought thither from Greece for the ornament of the temples, long after the latter had been built: they seem to belong to a later, (though not to a much later) age than those of Agina. a much later) age than those of Agina. the succession of one generation, or at the utmost of two, might very easily be con¬ ceived to have produced the difference of style between them. The collection of Etruscan vases is very numerous, —at least of those which are called Etruscan ; for antiquaries assert, that almost all are really Grecian: a genuine amateur is exceedingly fond of them, and will write you volumes on the merits of a milk-pot. Not being myself an adept, I can only say, that 1 think them extremely ele¬ gant, but that the drawings upon them, though often witty and amusing, have very seldom the least pretensions to correctness.

One of the most interesting things at the studti, is the unrolling of the ancient and carbonized manuscripts, found in the sub¬ terraneous ruins of Herculaneum. It is performed in a manner at once very simple and very ingenious (qualities which are usually found combined in the most useful inventions.) Every manuscript looks ex¬ actly like a piece of charcoal cut into the shape of an ancient volumen, and it requires the greatest care to prevent it from crumb¬ ling into mere coal-dust. For this purpose. the outer part is covered with very small pièces ofskin applied to it with a light glue or liquid gum. The roll is suspended on two ribbons, fastened to an upper board. which, with two parallel supporters, forms a sort of frame, of the shape of a Greek a sort of frame, of the shape of a Greek pi, (II). The roll is, moreover tied with two small threads to two pegs, which, being gently turned, unfold it by very slow de¬ grees.

The pegs are of course, fas¬ tened on the upper board also, and the beginning of the volume is drawn upwards by them, so as always to leave the unex¬ plored part of it resting on the ribbons by means of its own weight. The side boards have no other use than that of supporting the upper one. I wish I could make this description quite clear to those who have not seen the thing itself ; but the simplest machinery is often very difficult to be de¬ scribed. It is impossible to avoid the loss of some parts of the manuscripts, which the violent action of the heat, combined the violent action of the heat, combined with other accidents, has either melted together, or so completely fastened that they cannot be drawn asunder entire ; but these blanks are not nearly so numerous as might be expected.

Though we did not see the finest of the pictures on this visit, I think it best to no¬ tice them in this place, in order to close at once what I have to say of the Studii. These pictures had been saved by the Government on their flight to Sicily, at the time of the French invasion. They had been but recently brought back from Pa¬ lermo, and were not yet arranged in their proper places: but they are so excellent that they cannot fail to attract the highest ad¬ miration, even in the most unfavourable si¬ tuations. The finest of them, to my taste, is Guido Reni's Guardian Angel,—ofwhose calm assurance, gentleness, and nobleness, no description can convey an adequate idea. He holds his shield over a little boy ; who in an agony of fear, is trembling a prayer in an agony of fear, is trembling a prayer to heaven, whilst Satan is gnashing his teeth with rage, and is endeavouring to assail him under the shield, The danger and ter¬                            "

There may be greater technical beauties in the execution of others of the paintings, but there is no of others of the paintings, but there is no one of them so poetical as this. The celebrated Holy Family, by Leonardo da Vinci, would be admirable as any thing but what it is intended to represent. The Virgin looks even more than amorous : she has the very face of the same painter's figure of Vanity, in the Palazzo Sciarra at Rome. There is a St. John also by Leo¬ nardi da Vinci, who belongs to the same class ; and who looks more like a nymph of the Palais Royal, than a prophet. I re¬ member seeing this same face in other paintings of Leonardo da Vinci's in Lon¬ don; and 1 think it very probable that it was a portrait of some lady of his parti¬ cular acquaintance.

The prac- tice is moreover apt to withdraw a painter from the study and pursuit of ideal beauty; for which is substituted a set of features of which it is not to be expected that all be¬ holders will approve.

The whole process, however, was accomplished in a minute ; the dog was then carried out, and laid on the grass, where animation soon returned, and in a few moments he seemed as well and as lively as ever.

We had given express orders to the coachman to drive us up to the gate near which were the tombs of the chief citizens, that part of the town being by far the best preserved, and retaining the clearest traces of the place as it formerly the clearest traces of the place as it formerly existed. But it unfortunately fell to our lot to have a stupid headstrong fellow who drove us direct to the Soldier's Quarter, where there is nothing to create illusion or to give scope to the imagination. to give scope to the imagination.

This forum (if it was one) had been built by the Greeks, for it is nearly square like theirs, fifty-nine feet by fifty; the portico which surrounds it, inside of the shops, favours the supposition of its having been applied to this use, rather than for the purpose of barracks. The amphitheatre is at a considerable distance from this part, and, as I conceive, beyond the limits of the town. We were told, that it contained seats for thirty¬ six thousand spectators ; but, though I did not measure it, and was there for too short a time to take a very accurate note of it, 1think the number exaggerated, and that it ought to be reduced to eighteen or twenty thousand at most; which leaves it still large enough for such a place as Pom- peii and its immediate neighbourhood.

The gate, which contains a wider opening in the middle for carts and carriages, and two smaller ones on the sides for foot- passengers, is not handsome.

The city itself formerly rose in the shape of a grand amphitheatre, from the shore to the castle; but now it is reduced to a much more limited extent. There are only few streets and some churches on the lower part of the hill; the rest of the town is at its foot, of the hill; the rest of the town is at its foot, almost on a level with the bay. The street, or wharf, which skirts the sea, is remarkably fine; the rest of the town is indifferent.

Tamused myself on the sea-shore, un¬ der the Villa Reale, with taking sketches of the strange figures of the Lazzaroni, of the strange figures of the Lazzaroni, who were dragging their fishing-nets. They generally assemble in gangs of fifteen or twenty to each net,—that is, as many as the space will admit of : half the number would in truth be amply sufficient, but then the other half would starve, and they are the other half would starve, and they are contented to divide their slender profits with as many as can live on them.

On this day, they only gain- ed one grano by the first drag of the net, and the second produced only two very small fishes,—so small, as to be together small fishes,—so small, as to be together hardly worth one grano. One of the men began to cry bitterly and loudly at this ill success; for they are not paid by the hour, or by the day, but only according to what or by the day, but only according to what their occasional employer may earn by their labour; and when he gets nothing they can expect nothing. They eat alive some of the animals which they cannot sell, and among others a sort of sea-spider, something like a small crab, but transpa¬ rent.

I never saw a single battle amongst them, nor did I ever see any one of them guilty of a single malicious trick to another. They have at times, it is true, very foolish and ra¬ ther awkward amusements, such as forming two parties, one at each end of a street, and flinging large stones at one another ; but they have no other view in this than that of exerting their skill, either in throwing or parrying; for they do not shew the least VOL.

Of course they do not choose Toledo, or Chiaia, or such populous streets, for their arena,—but those places which are least frequented. The Lazzaroni are represented, in some books, with such extravagant exaggerations, that the authors really seem to have tor¬ tured their imagination, to invent in¬ credible instances of their stupidity, and even brutal ignorance. Who or what could have persuaded the author of Corinna, that some of them did not know even their own names ? As they are extremely averse from talking in general, and from replying to idle questions in particular, they might very probably return no answer to a stranger who should go up to them with- out any pretence, and plumply ask them * What is your name?\" But it would really                            "

The fact is, that, whenever the lively and brilliant imagination of a Nea¬ politan can be fixed to one particular course of study, either in the sciences or the fine arts, it can hardly fail of pro¬ ducing excellence in that particular line. But the prodigious variety of lively impres¬ sions to which the Neapolitans owe their sensual happiness, almost precludes the possibility of any peculiar and uncultivated nicety in their observations on whatever af¬ fects the senses, and particularly on sounds. Thère are many reasons why the inhabi¬ tants of the north must have a more acute faculty of discriminating sounds,—in other words, a more accurate ear—than those of Naples.

The Neapolitan dialect (or dialects,—for there is some difference in every parish, and perhaps even in every family) is much more disagreeable to the eye, than to the ear; its chief characteristick is the arbitrary transposition of the letters the arbitrary transposition of the letters which compose a word, and their fre¬ quent transmutation into others.

ANTIONY OF TARSIA. 217 On Thursday, 17th April, I went to the Convent of St. Anthony of Tarsia, in quest of Father de Meo, nephew and heir to the his¬ torian whom I have mentioned. A boy who performed, or rather who ought to have who performed, or rather who ought to have performed, the functions of porter to the monastery, told me thatI had only to ascend the first flight of steps, and that I could not possibly miss the Father’s cell. But his direction was so far from being accurate, that I had to enter five or six before I could find the right one. In each of these, I found a monk either in or on his bed, not one of whom would take the trouble either to shew me the way, or to explain to me to shew me the way, or to explain to me where their brother’s cell was situated. At length, by taking them all in succession, I came to him in his turn; and found him also in bed, like all the rest. Nor did he get up after my arrival ; but he inquired who I was, from whence I came, and in what town I was born, ere he thought of asking—or gave me time to tell—what 1 wanted. He informed me afterwards that no more than five hundred copies of his uncle’s work had been printed, and that                           "

Upon leaving the convent, I went to more than twenty booksellers' shops, without meeting a single creature who knew even the name of the best diplomatical work the name of the best diplomatical work on the history of their country, (for such this really was),—a work in eleven quarto volumes, printed only two-and-twenty years ago !

One remarkable circumstance which has never been sufficiently attended to, is this ; that though every person was allowed, by the constitution of the Lombards, to choose the law under which he desired to live and to be judged, the instances of people choosing the Roman law were very few, and of those who chose the Salic Constitu¬ tion still fewer.

La Cava, as 1 said before, is at the dis¬ tance of two short miles, on the way to Naples ; Vietri is not quite so far off, on the road to Salerno ; and the distance of the latter town is only an hour'’s comfortable walk.

As far as Vietri the scenery is entirely rural; but there the view opens at once on the magnificent Bay of Salerno, and upon the town, which is the most picturesque object Tever saw. Vegetation is not, however, so fine in this part as 1 had expected to find it; for I had imagined a country embellished with lofty palm-trees, of which I saw no more than four or five on the whole way from Naples to Pæstum. Orange trees are not to be seen to Pæstum. Orange trees are not to be seen except in gardens, until you reach Salerno, where they are planted in groves. There are some fine Pomegranates, and a great number of Carob trees, the fruit of which (the locust-bean) is very nutritious, and is But on of great use to the poorer classes. the whole, our trees in Switzerland are much finer and more picturesque than those of the south of Italy.

A little to the right, on the face of the steep cliff, stands the singular town of Raita, which struck me no less by its ex¬ treme neatness and its comfortable and even wealthy appearance, than by the in- conveniency of the streets, or rather ter¬ races, on which the houses are built, one above another, so às to be almost inacces¬ sible to weak and delicate persons. The inhabitants of Raita were grown wealthy by commerce. War had, however, greatly di¬ minished their prosperity, which Itrust will return with the other blessings of peace. It is a curious circumstance, that the very next town to this flourishing place should be the poorest in the district. I mean Citarra, where 1 was told that no less than four hundred persons had been starved to death that winter, making more than 13 per cent. on the whole population of thrée thousand souls !

Only five or six died at Corpo di Cava, out of a population of four hundred and fifty ; I mean died of hunger, for here too it was felt, in spite of the abbot's cha¬ ritable cares. He formerly kept a table for one hundred paupers every day ; but that noble institution fell, of course, with the income by which (in conformity to the foundation-statutes, which enjoin hospitality to all strangers without exception) it had been supported. The abbot has another cure, which is much more miserable than this; and it was probably during one of his excursions to the latter that the few deaths occurred at Corpo di Cava. I had intended to pay a visit to Amalfi, during my stay at La Cava, but the path which leads thither over the mountain was represented to me as exceedingly danger¬ ous, besidés being infested by robbers; and the weather was so stormy as to preclude the weather was so stormy as to preclude my going by sea.

The highest poetical beau¬ ties could not possibly render it fit to be tolerated ; but even in point of poetry the play has very little merit. There is indeed one fine scene between Aristodemus and Lisander; and the piece contains many noble lines; but so many of the latter are plagiarisms from the French poets, that it is difficult to know which are Monti's and which are theirs. The scene of the avowal is almost literally translated from Racine's Phédre; but Phædra is deeply tragical when she confesses a passion which she has so she confesses a passion which she has so long resisted at the peril of her life; Aristo¬ demus is merely nauseous, when he relates                            "

Every explosion of fire was preceded by a bellowing of thunder in the moun- tain.

The smallest of these stones were of the size of cannon-balls, the greater number like the largest bomb-shells, others were rocks of four, five, or six cubic feet, and some of enormous irregular dimensions. The latter generally fall on the ridge of the crater, and roll down its side, splitting into fragments as they strike against the hard and cutting masses of cold lava. Some of these stones, éven while on fire, are ex¬ tremely hard, and cannot easily be cleft even with an iron wedge; but the larger ones are like a paste of fire, and while they are of a red heat are easily divided into are of a red heat are easily divided into smaller pieces.

Any person who could accurately fancy the effect of five hundred thousand sky rockets, darting up at once to a height of three or four thousand feet, and then falling back in the shape of red balls, shells, and large rocks on fire, might have an idea of a single explosion ; but I doubt whether any imagination could be suffi¬                            "

That feeling was soon increased by a shower of red stones which now fell around us, and some even at a considerable distance beyond us. Salvator enjoined us immediately to retire, but at the same time warned us not to run, but to keep looking up as the only way to evade the stones, against which the most rapid flight was no security. They are visible at so great a height that one has always time to move out of the direction of their fall; and they are of the direction of their fall; and they are too large to threaten you with more than one or two at a time. In short, we escaped from every danger ; and the only circum¬ stance that was particularly disagreeable to us, was the sand which filled our eyes at every explosion from the higher crater.

A government whose subjects are starving by hundreds, ought, one would think, to do every thing in its power to draw foreigners to their assistance; instead of which this Government seems to multiply the difficulties of travelling in its territories, as if to prevent the visits of strangers. On my return-to Castellamare, I was detained for more than a quarter of an hour at the barrier of Naples, because I had no card of residence, without which, I was told, Iought not to have ventured out of the city. This seemed peculiarly ridi¬ culous at a time when Europe enjoyed à more profound, and to all appearance, à more durable peace than for ages past. Vexed as I was with all the trouble which Iwas obliged to take, in order to enable myself to leave Naples, I could not but be highly amused by a contest between the keepers of two rival coffee-houses near the post-office; the one at the house No. 14, and the other at No. 15.

The ice-cream though so unusually cheap, was fully as good as at the greater coffee-houses, but the spoons were of pewter, instead of silver.

The first began by offering his oranges for one grano, the second then offered his for half the price; the first then gave three for a grano, upon which the second, not content with lowering his price accordingly, was led on by the heat of competition to stuff his fruit into the pockets of the by-standers, whe- ther they chose to have it or not. In this manner three young sailors got most of the oranges for nothing; and if the baskets had not by this process been quickly emptied, the amateurs would at last probably have even been paid for ac¬ cepting the fruit. An event took place just at the time of my departure from Naples, which I could not have believed merely upon publick rumour, but which Iwas assured by several persons who were likely to be correctly in¬ formed, had really happened.

It is also said that the rob¬ ber-chief insisted upon the treaty being signed by an Austrian officer ! Barda¬ relli was not looked upon in the light of an ordinary highwayman by the people an ordinary highwayman by the people of Naples ; he never attacked private per¬ sons, but only publick couriers, and con¬ voys sent by the government with money to distant provinces : he was even said to make frequent donations to poor merchants and other men in distress who fell into his power, out of his levies on the royal trea¬ sury. The innkeepers know him well, and there is not one of them who would betray him; one of them, in fact, told me that Bardarelli frequented his house, and that he paid for every thing nobly. I think it due in fairness to the Neapolitan Govern¬ ment, to observe that they do not merit all the obloquy to which they are subjected by the avowed impossibility of subduing these banditti.

The most remarkable monument of an¬ tiquity in Spoleto, is that part of the walls which had been raised by the earliest in¬ habitants of Italy; enough of which remains to mark the exact boundary of the city, as it existed before the time of the Romans. There was a fortress on the top of the hill ; and the town occupied very nearly the same space as it does in our days,¬ namely, the slope from the fortress to the plain below. This plan seems to have been observed in all the cities, whose Cyclopean walls refer their origin to the same age and the same nation. The mode of structure of those walls is so very extraordinary, that it is hardly possible that two distinct nations could separately have invented and adopted it, or that the same nation should have persevered in it beyond the age in which it was invented.

But the most surprising circumstance is, that all this durability is attained without cement. It may easily be conceived that very large square stones, placed in a regular manner, may, by their own weight, form a solid and durable wall ; but the wonder is that stones of so many various forms and di¬ mensions, should be held together by the mere skill with which they are arranged. It is a work of patience and perseverance, which the mind is at once disposed to refer to the heroick ages.

It was one of those unfortunate states asserted to have belonged to the Countess Matilda; an assertion not only completely false, but admitted to be so by the most monkish of modern Roman writers, Father Fatteschi. Abandoning therefore the claims founded on this pretended title, he attempts to prove that his sovereign had more ancient, and better rights to the possession of the Duchy of Spoleto and Marquisate of Camerino, by the donation of Charle¬ magne to Pope Adrian.

She is, however, much more beautiful than any other work of Canova’s that I have seen (except per¬ haps—though that is in quite another style -his Reposing Lion, in St. Peter's Church at Rome,) but she has some very glaring defects. Her legs are deficient in delicacy; her waist is not so slender nor her hips so her waist is not so slender nor her hips so full as perfect beauty would require; but, above all, the outline on the right side, de¬ scending from the girdle to the knee, is strikingly incorrect. The antique Venus, in Pierantoni’s study at Rome, is; in my opi¬                            "

The face of Canova's Venus is, however, quite delight¬ ful; her head-dress extremely elegant; and her attitude charming, though wanting in dignity and self-possession,—the artist seeming not to have been aware that the modesty of Venus ought to be expressed very differently from that of a mortal, or a nymph. The drapery is likewise very good, though it might have produced a better effect, if it had been represented of a finer texture. In short, Canova’s Venus is an ex¬ ceedingly pretty girl, but the Venus de Medici is the handsomest of goddesses. I like the plan of appropriating one whole room, exclusively, to that collection of statues supposed to represent the Family of Niobe. It is indeed essential to the perfect enjoyment of works of art, that the mind should be directed to the contempla¬ tion of a single story at a time, undisturbed by the intrusion of incongruous images. The statues which compose this group are evidently not all by the same hand ; two of them in particular are bad copies of itwo                            "

The daughter on the left is divinely beauti¬ ful, and of admirable workmanship. The dying son is perfection itself : it is impos¬ sible to resist the deeply melancholy feel¬ ing which he inspires. One of the finest pièces in the present group is an inter¬ loper-a Psyche, whose attitude pointed her out as a fit representative of one of the statues which had been lost. Her face is not so handsome as that of the other children, and there is no sort of resemblance to them in the features ; but it is in itself one of the noblest monu¬ it is in itself one of the noblest monu¬ ments of ancient sculpture. There is much inequality in the draperies throughout the group, some of them being admirable, and others of very indifferent execution. Mr. Cockerell's system, with respect to this group, is very ingenious, but I doubt whe¬ ther it be founded in truth. Some of the highest and most difficult beauties of the workmanship would have been completely lost in the pediment of a lofty temple; and there are deficiencies in other points which                            "

I may possibly be called a barbarian for dissenting from the general opinion as to the transcendent merit of the principal the transcendent merit of the principal figure,—that of Niobe. Her beauty is in- deed of a sublime character, but the ex¬ pression of grief and anguish is not suffi¬ ciently marked. The general observation is, that her grief is that of a goddess; and people rest satisfied with this answer, which I own is far from satisfying me. Niobe was not a goddess, she was a wo¬ man, and a mother, and her whole history turns on these two points only. Her mouth expresses rather indifference than any spe¬ cifick emotion, and her forehead and eye- brows are not sufficiently indicative of her feelings. In this respect the artist has taken a very different view of his task, and I a very different view of his task, and I think a less just one, than the sculptor who gave such a sublime degree of agony to Laocoon.

(The reader will remember that, when I speak of the national character, my obser¬ vations are always made on the lower classes of wealthy citizens, or on the upper classes of tradesmen.)

Whichever was the cause, he went one day into Sal¬ vetti's room with two loaded pistols, and fired at him with one of them ; but Salvetti warded off the shot with his hand, which was wounded, and Blanc was im¬ mediately overpowered and locked up in a room, though without having been dis¬ armed. That room, which was just oppo¬ site my windows, was on the ground-floor to the back of the post-house ; and the re- port of the pistol, followed immediately by the vehement vociferations of the poor wretch, instantly filled the whole yard with a crowd of the common people of the neighbourhood. He harangued them with a violence and agitation, which sufficiently a violence and agitation, which sufficiently evinced his insanity, and every now and then he applied both pistols to his temples as if he were on the point of blowing out his brains, as he declared he would.

It might be good enough for its former destination, when it was occupied by the bastards of a Pope; but it is really a shabby residence for an Archduchess of Austria, who has worn an imperial crown.

In his tragedy of Zaire, Voltaire might, perhaps, find some apology for having made Luzignan a respectable old man; but nothing in the world could excuse his loading a character so completely histo¬ riçal as that of Mahomet, with the most dis¬ gusting atrocities of his own mere invention.

But Voltaire cared as little for probability as he did for historical, or for probability as he did for historical, or any other kind of truth : his object was to strike the multitude,—and to labour for his sect, by spreading the most execrable maxims under borrowed names. This it is which makes his plays so inferior to those of many poets who had not nearly the same capabilities of perfection : he is always himself, never the person whom he repre- sents as speaking: his works contain a multitude of good verses and brilliant ideas, but not a single word that the warmth of a generous heart, or the violence of genuine a generous heart, or the violence of genuine passion, would have dictated.

Grassini and the Princess Na¬ talia Havansky of Moscow (now Mrs. Bul¬ gakof,) are the two best singers that I ever heard, because the musick of their voices was really musick for the heart, as much as for the ear. I preferred the prayer of the Vergine del Sole\" by the former, and “ Ciel pietoso\" by the latter, to all the grand bra¬ vuras of Billington, Banti, or Catalani,—and even to Handel, sung by Madame Mara, who in that particular style of musick has not yet been equalled. 1 also visited the Teatro Re, where I had the pleasure of seeing a very good tragic actor, in a play which, with too intricate a plot, contained several very interesting scenes, and in which there was no buffoon. But I had a still greater satisfaction,—in seeing one of Goldonis charming plays well performed, and warmly applauded. It was La Donna bizarra, which is no less fantastical than its title; for the heroine, who is imperious, intriguing, lying, caprici¬ ous, and a great coquet, marries at last the man whom she prefers, and who dotes upon her in spite of all her defects.

At the Teatro Carcano I heard Rossini's Elizabeth, which pleased me infinitely better here than at Naples, because this theatre, being built entirely of wood, gives a better effect to the musick. The prima Donna, Signora Sala, was deficient in flexibility of voice, and was frequently obliged to alter some of the most difficult passages ; but her tones were very fine, and she sung with a good deal of expression,—which I may also say of her rival, the second singer, Signora Brescia.
