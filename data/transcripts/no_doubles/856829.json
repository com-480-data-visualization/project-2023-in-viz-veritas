            "* The province of Abruzzo, unfrequented by the generality of travellers, and unknown even to the inhabitants of the neighbouring districts, like Sicily, has been represented as a country uncivilized with regard to society, infested by robbers, inaccessible from mountains, and fitter for the residence of wild beasts than of rational beings. But I must here repeat with gratitude, that in these remote and unfrequented tracts we meet with that genuine and cordial hospitality, which is too seldom to be found in more favoured and more populous countries ; and such as I shall for ever call to mind with pleasure and grateful remembrance. and more populous countries ; and such as I shall for ever call to mind with pleasure and grateful remembrance.

            "PREFACE. IN offering this Volume to the Public, it is almost necessary to state, that its object is the illustration of a part of Italy which, though nowise inferior in interest to those portions of that country so commonly visited, has hitherto attracted but little attention. With the exception of the Tours by Sir R. CoLT HoARE, Bart., and the Honourable KEPPEL CRAVEN, I am not aware of any published account of the Abruzzi provinces in English; and the drawings with which the following pages are illustrated are, I believe, the first hitherto given of a part of Central Italy as romantic as it is unfrequented. of a part of Central Italy as romantic as it is unfrequented. I would beg the indulgence of the Public towards the literary por¬ tion of the Work, which I have thought it right to print with little alteration from my own journals written during my rambles, adding only such historical and other information concerning the places visited, as I have sought for in various Authors. Much yet remains to be explored and illustrated throughout the northern provinces of the kingdom of Naples, and so far from this Volume containing a full account of that interesting country, I should wish it to be regarded as a suggestion for the more careful observation of future and abler Tourists. I have executed the whole of the Lithographic drawings from my own sketches, and have endeavoured to preserve a close fidelity to the Originals. The Vignettes are also by my own hand, excepting the Architectural subjects, which were transferred to the wood from the Architectural subjects, which were transferred to the wood from my sketches by Mr. R. BRANSTON.                         "

            "viil To those Ladies, to whose kindness I owe the arrangement of the Airs given at the end of the Volume, my best thanks are due ; but I regret, that, owing to the difficulty of writing correctly such music as is only retained by ear, the Appendix is less perfect than I could have wished. The Lithographic Drawings have been printed at the establishment of Messrs. HULLMANDEL and WALTON. To those Gentlemen, and to the various Artists by whom my drawings on wood have been engraved, as well as to Messrs. BENTLEY and Co., Printers, I am desirous of as well as to Messrs. BENTLEY and Co., Printers, I am desirous of expressing my thanks for the care bestowed on their several de¬ partments. During a long residence in Italy, I have had opportunities of col¬ lecting numerous illustrations of scenery little known in England, especially of that in the near neighbourhood of Rome; and should the present Volume meet with the approbation of the Public, a second the present Volume meet with the approbation of the Public, a second series of Excursions may be anticipated at some future period.

TULY 26th, 1843.—Ir was not without experiencing many delays that we or were at last enabled to begin our long-proposed tour in the Abruzzi, three Northern provinces of the kingdom of Naples. The plan arranged was, first, that we should gain a general idea of our ground on horseback, and afterwards that I should proceed alone on foot to sketch and examine details. C. K. lent me his Arab, (by name Gridiron) he riding the iron-gray; and, having sent my luggage to Rieti, we started from Frascati, with our caligie strapped before our saddles, on as brilliant a morning We took our way  as one could desire for the beginning of a long journey. along the vine-covered hills of Monte Porzio and Monte Compatri, and down to the melancholy Colonna, and so across the fresh bright Campagna to Gallicano, the melancholy Colonna, and so across the fresh bright Campagna to Gallicano, which is thought by some antiquaries to be the site of the ancient Pedum, though by others that city is supposed to have been situated at Zagarolo.: There is a most beautiful view of the modern town about a mile and a half before you reach it, rising on its long, narrow rock of tufa over the wide plain, and backed by the high mountain range of Guadagnolo, the loftiest in the neighbourhood of Rome. From this point the entrance is well seen to that remarkable cut by Cramer, An. Italy, vol. ii. 73. B                          "

Throughout its extent the old pavement of the Via Prænestina is quite perfect; and a solemn feeling of antiquity impresses you as you pass along it, shaded by walls of rock more than seventy feet in height, half covered with luxuriant foliage. The ancient road is here twenty-seven feet in breadth; its usual width being but fourteen. A little chapel halfvay in breadth; its usual width being but fourteen.

The Historical legends of Pedum are these: — that it was one of the Latin cities leagued to restore Tarquin; was allied with the Romans, and captured by Coriolanus; united itself with the Tiburtines, and was destroyed by Nor is L. Furius Camillus. Thenceforward Pedum is heard of no more. there any known record of Gallicano till A.D. 992, when (and until the thirteenth century) it belonged to the Conti: afterwards to the Colonna, through whom it passed to the Pallavicini. Of the usual vicissitudes by siege and pillage, common to all the towns of the Roman Campagna during the middle ages, Gallicano was not without its share : at present it is little more than a village, and scarcely contains one thousand inhabitants. Trotting away over the flat ground, or winding slowly down and up the steep sides of woody ravines, we skirted the grounds of Villa Catena, and were soon at Poli, placed at the foot of the mountain of Guadagnolo, whose sides we began to ascend, both as the shortest way of reaching Subiaco ere night. and because we wished to visit the picturesque Mentorella Chapel near its summit. But we had not started early enough to avoid the noon-day heat. which was rather severe as we toiled up the mule-path, leading our horses, which had yet a long day’s work before them; and we rejoiced to arrive at the cool fountain two-thirds of the way up. There is something exceedingly grand Poussinesque in the rock of Guadagnolo, as seen from this shady fount ; and yet, often as I have been there I was always too hot or too tired to sketch it. What an ascent! The plains of Rome stretched out at our feet, and unfolding like a map at every step. At the crowning height, —the well-known square head of Guadagnolo, which is the crowning height, —the well-known square head of Guadagnolo, which is more than four thousand feet above the level of the sea, and is seen from everj part of the Campagna,—one is rather surprised to find a compact little town or village (called also Guadagnolo, and containing between two and three hundred inhabitants,) oddly wedged as it were into the rocks which surround the whole place with a natural wall, and hide even the highest houses.“ This strange little a Nibbi, Anal. ii. 552. a Nibbi, Anal. ii. 552. » The town of Guadagnolo, according to Nibbi, “è situato sopra una delle cime del Monte Vulturella, o Mentorella, più alta di quella di Monte Gennaro, e per conseguenza è la punta più elevata di quelle che o Mentorella, più alta di quella di Monte Gennaro, e per conseguenza è la punta più elevata di quelle che dominano immediatamente la campagna di Roma.\"—Nibbi, Anal. ii. 152.

The earliest records of it as à town date about 1137; and it has belonged, with Poli, to the Counts of Tusculum and Segni? It was purchased by the father of the present Duke of Braciano, who is also Duke of Poli and Guadagnolo. Though at so great of Braciano, who is also Duke of Poli and Guadagnolo. Though at so great an elevation, its little territory is very fertile in corn and pasture; and, before an elevation, its little territory is very fertile in corn and pasture; and, before scaling the last outworks of this mountain fortress, we passed through many a smiling field and cheerful harvest-scene. We were not sorry to reach the house inhabited by the Ministro or Steward of Torlonia, and his uncle, who rejoices in the name of Don Ermenengildo Salviati, and is Archpriest of the Mentorella Chapel. Here we reposed through the heat of the day; for the Casa Salviati is the palace of Guadagnolo, and the good-natured old clergyman piques himself not unreasonably on the neatnes of his stables and garden. The roof the house is level with the highest rocks on the mountain, forming a of the house is level with the highest rocks on the mountain, forming a sort of terace, whence at sun-rise the glory of the vast scene is beyond measure impressive. Having suffcienty rested and fed Gridiron, Iron-gray, and ourselves, we proceeded downyard on our way to Subiaco; but, about a quarter of a mile below the town, the remarkable Hermitage and Church of La Mentorella caused us some delay. These are built on the edge of an isolated pre¬ cpice, jutting out from the mountain side over the valley of Girano, and possess interest from their antiquity and the legends attached to them, as well as from the wild character of the scenery in which they are placed Here, in a cave at the foot of the rock, San Benedetto is believed to have lived in the sixth century, previous to his going to Subiaco; and a tradition of far carlier date (during the reign of the Emperor Trajan) re¬ presents the crag of La Mentorella as that where a vision of the deer with a crucikx between his horns led to the conversion of St. Eustace to Christianity.

By reason of all such delays, it was late ere we reached the valley of Girano; fully owning the justice of Signor Nibbis remark on the situation of Guadagnolo, “ incommoda oltremodo è la sua situazione. Glad to be at the bottom of the mountain, we crossed the little plain, passed Girano, and wound through beautiful chesnut woods, till we reached the hills overlooking the valley below Civitella, just as heavy purple clouds the hills overlooking the valley below Civitella, just as heavy purple clouds shut out the last red line of sun-set. Thenceforth we journeyed on in utter darkness, over paths by no means pleasant, to Subiaco, where we slept. "

Having passed Arsoli,' (the frontier town of the Roman States,) crowned by the palace of Prince Massimo, and having the Roman States,) crowned by the palace of Prince Massimo, and having caught a glimpse of Riofreddo on our left, we were soon in the pretty plain of Cavaliere, than which, though not of great extent, there are few more of Cavaliere, than which, though not of great extent, there are few more pleasing; for it is so surrounded by towns perched on their hills, that, which¬ ever way you turn, there is an interesting object,—Valinfreddo, Poggio-Cinolfo, Pereto, Collalto, Camerata, Oricoli, Rocca di Botte, &amp;c.

Hence the name of the hamlet, and of the Pianura di Cavaliereb, which abounds in game, and is greatly frequented by sportsmen. Here we entered the Neapolitan province of Abruzzo Secondo Ulteriore The word Abruzzo is derived by antiquaries from the Prætutii, a people anciently inhabiting the northern part of the territory, which now forms the kingdom of Naples. Prætutia by the Lombards was changed into Aprutium, and with the Italians it became Abruzzo.

            "9 By far the greater portion of the territory of the three Abruzzi is of a mountainous character, some of the highest points of the Apennines being situated in these provinces : Monte Corno (usually called Il Gran Sasso d'Italia), Terminillo, and Velino, in the Abruzzo Ult. 2“; and the Maiella in Abruzzo Citeriore. Of these, Monte Corno is 9577 Paris feet above the level of the sea; Terminillo, 6597; Velino, about 7000 ; La Maiella, 8000. The provinces of Chieti and Teramo are less interesting to a landscape painter than that of Aquila, the scenery of which, though somewhat bleak, is wild and majestic to a great degree : its towns also have more attractions both in a picturesque and historical point of view, and I confess my prejudices are in a picturesque and historical point of view, and I confess my prejudices are equally in favour of its inhabitants. Most of the country between the Apen¬ nines and the Adriatic is highly cultivated, abounding with the vine, olive, &amp;c.: that in the higher ground of the Abruzzi 1° and 20° Ult. is chiefly pasture land. To the south and east of the provinces, a large tract, bounded by the Terra di Lavoro and the Papal States, is thickly wooded; but extreme bareness is the characteristic of the greater extent of the Abruzzese territory. The flocks of the Abruzzo Ulteriore 2°, according to Del Re, amount to seven hundred thousand head in number, most part of which migrate annually to Apulia at the end of September, by the three principal tratturi or sheepwalks commencing in the neighbourhood of Aquila, Celano, and Pescaseroli; and return by the same route after the shearing in May. Part go to the Roman Campagna in October, by the route of Rieti or Arsoli : these are chiefly from the districts of Civita Ducale and Aquila. Some remain their native plains. the districts of Civita Ducale and Aquila. Some remain their native plains.

One or two more general remarks regarding the provinces of the Abruzzi may be allowed. The great valleys in the heart of the Apennines are subject to the scourge of earthquakes, and that most frequently and fatally. And the inhabitants, for courtesy, simplicity, and hospitality, are a proverb among Italians as well as strangers. as well as strangers. A short boundary question ensued on reaching the Neapolitan frontier at Cavaliere, where, however, we were scarcely detained by some very civil offi¬ cials, so on we cantered, fording a stream below Poggio Cinolfo, and soon arriving at Carsôli, hidden from the plain a little nook of its own. A ruined bridge below, and a shattered castle above, give a more picturesque than comfortable air to the modern town, which contains eight or nine thousand inhabitants, and is successor to, though not on the same site as, the ancient Carseoli : within, dirty narrow streets, only redeemed here and there by a bit of Gothic door window, raise no favourable idea of the present condition of this once respectable abode of the Equi, where they sacrificed foxes to Ceres, and where the Romans imprisoned Bituitus, king of Thrace.“ It was nearly noon: so we put up our horses, and having satisfied the authorities as to our passports and permessi“ for our steeds, we adjourned to a wretched Locanda, where the Oste flattered us with hopes of something to eat, bidding us wait in a closet, very nearly filled up by a large bed, a cracked spinette, and an inclined table with uncertain legs: but when the repast was brought, both eatables and drinkables were such that, though pretty well used to uncommon food, we were compelled to be content with bread and water; to uncommon food, we were compelled to be content with bread and water; and, leaving our dinner in the charming chamber, where “ cold and unho¬ Giustiniani, Diz.

This was the first place where we encountered that horrible beverage, called Vino Coto, which is wine boiled when new to make it keep ; and, spite of its nasti ness, is drunk all over the Abruzzi by the common people. I have tasted some, kept for many years, that was little inferior to good Marsala, but when new, it is filthy beyond imagination. About two, we set off again, by a pathway through a rising valley. Beyond Carsoli, there is no road for carriages into the Abruzzi: bare rocks were on our left, and on our right high hills, covered, as far as eye could reach, with forests of oak, looking black and untrodden enough to shelter a world of bears and wolves. Patience, and endurance of heat, bore us to a world of bears and wolves. Patience, and endurance of heat, bore us to Colli, an uninteresting village, which offered us nothing to remark beyond the courtesy and simple good-breeding of its peasant inhabitants. Beyond this, we toiled onward through this long stony pass, and all our hopes were fixed on Rocca di Cerri, a village at the top of the hill; on arriving at which, we confessed to being well repaid for our labour, by the view over the sublime Marsica. On our left, the snowy peaks of Velino, more than seven thousand feet in height, were gloomy beneath threatening clouds, and a wild confusion of misty mountains closed that side of the Far below, in bright sun-shine, lay a long streak of the blue Lake scene. of Fucino, with its beautiful plain, dotted and spangled with woods and villages; and beyond the Lake uprose the strangely-formed mountain of Celano, with many a high range of faint, blue hills, while the dark-castled rocks and formidable pass of Tagliacozo were at our feet. Having admired all this, we descended by a steep serpentine path, and were soon at the level of the Castle of Tagliacozzo, which guards the entrance to the plain below. I have never seen anything more majestic than the approach to Tagla¬ cozzo. It is a precipitous ravine, almost artificial in appearance; and, by some, indeed, considered as having been partly formed by the Romans, for the transit of the Via Valeria. A monastery, with a Calvario, or range of shrines, stands at the entrance of this extraordinary gorge, the portals of which are, on one hand, huge crags, crested with a ruined castle; on the                                    "

(See PLATE I.) Long time we remained enjoying this sublime scene, and debating whe- ther we should go on to Avezzano for the night, or remain at Tagliacozzo, as we had a letter of recommendation to its greatest proprietor. Don Filippo Mastroddi. We resolved finally to proceed ; party, because on pre¬ senting ourselves to the family, we might have been induced to stay a longer time than we could well afford for our equestrian ramble, in which we had determined. to see as much as possible in a short period; and partly, because we were not so well provided with dress as a visit to so grandiose a Palazzo as the Casa Mastroddi might render desirable. So down we went, by a street strongly resembling a stair-case, to the plain below, from whence the town has a most singular appearance, the Palazzo Mastroddi occupying a fine situation the green near the Piazza.

Tagliacozzo was then, perhaps, the more important place. At present, the town contains upwards of three thousand inhabitants, and is the most thriving in all the Marsica. There is no record of Taliacozzo having been the site of any ancient city; though Taliaquitium, Taleacotium, have called forth a great deal of ingenuity from various antiquarian etymologists. It seems to have been a stronghold of importance, and its possession was often contested during the divisions of the middle ages, as commanding a passage between the Papal and Neapolitan dominions: the Counts, or Dukes of Tagliacozzo, were conse- quently, powerful Barons. In 1442 A.D., it was bestowed on the Orsini by King Alfonso : and, in 1497, Fabrizio Colonna received it from King Ferrante; and the Colonnesi still hold much of the territory round the town.\" Tagliacozzo is much resorted to by the devout, from its containing the remains of the Bishop Tommaso di Celano, whose bones rest in the church of St. Francesco. The Madonna, called dell' Oriente, (but from what cause even the labours of the Bishop of Venosa give no information,) is also an object of great veneration.

As the afternoon grew cooler, and our freshened horses gallopped gaily over the turf, bordering the road to Avez¬ zano, every step was over ground notorious for interest of antiquity, or of more modern history, and every change of the prospect had some new charm: the line of Monte Velino sweeping down to the plain, and Magli¬ ano, Capelle, or other villages, glittering from a wide space of yellow corn There was most ancient Alba on its twin hills; the prison of Siphax, Perseus, and other captive kings, in the days of Roman conquests: there the mountains beyond the Liris, and the high Serra di Sant' Antonio, and the dark forests of the Equi. There were the Campi Valentini, the golden plains, where Corradino and Charles of Anjou threw the deciding die for the Crown of Naples. That little heap of gray ruin is all now re¬ maining of the splendid Cistercian monastery, founded by the victor: and, at the highest point of the town of Scurcola, is the spire of the church, yet con¬ taining the image of the Madonna, found below the ruins of the convent. An indescribable quiet, a feeling of distance from the busy world, per¬ vades this sequestered district. No road connects the Marsica, (or district where the ancient Marsi resided,) with either Rome or Naples. The old Via Valeria passed through it from Rome, and its vestiges are still visible near the Castle of Tagliacozzo; but now the only roads for carriages in the whole territory are from Tagliacozzo to Avezzano, Celano, and Magliano; and one from Capistrello to Sora, not yet completed. Shut up in its own circle of high mountains, the Marsica has no communication (beyond that afforded by mule-tracks) with any great city; and it possesses, besides the delight of its unfrequented tranquillity, more attractions among its inhabit¬ ants, its scenery, and antiquities, than any place it has been ever my for¬ tune to visit. Passing on through the village of Capelle, and leaving Alba on our left, to be visited in my second journey, we were soon in sight of Avezzano, standing in the low ground near the Lake of Fucino, which lay behind it, a narrow blue line, bounded by beautiful mountains, purple in the light of a narrow blue line, bounded by beautiful mountains, purple in the light of                                    "

One house, a casa Corradini, was indicated as likely to receive us, and so we entered the town in search of it. Though a Capo di Distretto, Avezzano is not a promising town in appearance ; there are some few good palaces and convents, but the general effect of its streets is mean and uninteresting. It is not, I believe, the suc¬ cessor of any ancient city, yet Corsignani and others seek to derive its name                          "

Be this as it may, the decay of such important places of antiquity as Alba, Marrubium, Angizia, &amp;c., may well important places of antiquity as Alba, Marrubium, Angizia, & may well have given rise to the more modern towns in their neighbourhood. Avez¬ zano was probably no inconsiderable town in the middle ages, since we read of it as the temporary abode of the emperor Frederic, in 1242.2 Of the people here, as of all we had met since our entering the Abruzzi, the pre¬ vailing character was politeness and goodnature. The town contains about two thousand five hundred inhabitants. We sate sometime on our horses, waiting for the Padrone of our lodg- ings, that were to be, and meanwhile, were highly amused by one of those torrents of pigs, common to Italian country towns, when the sable tribe, for black they are all, return at night to supper. Most of these towns being upon hills, the swine are obliged to go up, and therefore arrive in a state of placid expectation; but at Avezzano, they all have to come dovn hill, and so rush into the piazza in an uncontrollable frenzy. How we did laugh, to the diversion of half the rabble of the town, who had come to gaze on us, as the immense current of grunters burst from the long street into the market-place, with a wonderful hubbub, and ran shrieking away through all the lanes of the place. When the pig-storm was over, and we had seen to our steeds, we made the most of the short remaining light and hurried to our lodgings, where the most of the short remaining light and hurried to our lodgings, where three ineffably polite females shewed us into a large, raftered room, of a bewildering aspect, with much furniture, and a great assortment of old clothes, and strewed with articles of female dress, intermixed rather oddly with fowls of all sizes, fluttering about in every direction, over and under two very misshapen beds. All this, added to the walls having a speckly appearance, which to the initiated, denotes the presence of certain flat entomological visitors, did not promise much repose; nor did the pensive chirping of an afflicted, one-winged chicken, upon whom one of our land- ladies lavished the most touching caresses, at all strengthen our admiration of the dormitory we had selected.

Still there was daylight left for a stroll ; so we set off on foot to the Lake, (hardly a mile distant,) through the quietest green lanes of turf, bor¬ dered by poplars, and enclosing plantations of low vines. How fresh the air! How deliciously calm the shallow, transparent waters! How grateful the placid beauty of that lovely prospect, after all the heat of the day ! the placid beauty of that lovely prospect, after all the heat of the day !

By sunrise we had taken our coffee and bread, and were on our horses; our day’s programme being to see the Emissario, and then to coast the Lake, halting where choice or accident might determine, making a short day for the sake of Irongray and Gridiron.

The ancient cities, once flourishing on its borders, have either utterly disappeared, or have left scanty traces whereby to determine their position; and, at the present day, the most interesting antiquity the immediate vicinity can boast of is the great Emissario, a pas¬ sage or tunnel, about nineteen feet in height, nine broad, and nearly three miles in length, constructed by the Emperor Claudius,' for the purpose of carrying off the waters of the Lake (which frequently inundated the sur- rounding country) into the river Liris.“ It is needless to repeat the parti¬ culars of the great naval exhibition of a combat on the Lake, between nineteen thousand gladiators, given by the Emperor at the opening of the Emissario, (to complete which, thirty thousand slaves had laboured for eleven years,) since the accounts given by Roman historians and modern antiquaries are sufficiently explicit. After the time of Claudius, this great work was repaired by Hadrian and Trajan; but with the fall of the Roman Empire it gradually decayed, and the neglect occasioned by the successive incursions of barbarians went far to destroy this magnificent monument of antiquity. In A.D. 1240 the Emperor Frederic II. ordered the Emissario to be re-opened, and the work was greatly advanced, when his death put a stop to its progress. King Alfonso is supposed to have contemplated its recommencement; but the dis¬ turbances of his reign, or the change of viceroys, prevented its execution. Towards the middle of the 16th century, the Colonna, who possessed most of the surrounding territory, also commenced the work of restoration, but of the surrounding territory, also commenced the work of restoration, but desisted from want of funds. In 1786, King Ferdinand attempted to repair the Emissario; but the wars of Europe, at the end of the last cen¬ tury, were the cause of the failure of his design.“ In 1826 the work of repair was again resumed, and in 1831 was much advanced; but since that time decay has pursued her work of destruction unopposed. Thus, through the long course of eighteen centuries, the object so long desired has never been attained, nor does it seem very likely to be. a « Non meno colla speranza della gloria che con quella dell’ utile.\" Ant. i. 371. a « Non meno colla speranza della gloria che con quella dell’ utile.\" Ant. i. 371. b Guatt. iii. 50.

Among the common people, it is said’ to be a popular belief, that the waters rise and decrease every seven years. The works of Antinori and Afan di Rivera contain much in¬ formation the subject, as well as minute details relative to the construction of the Emissario. In 1752, it is recorded, that the Lake of Fucino was so low, that the foundations of the ancient Marruvium were seen, and several statues of the foundations of the ancient Marruvium were seen, and several statues of Claudius and Agrippina were discovered and sent to Caserta. In 1783 the Lake began to increase, and rose fifteen palmi' before the year 1787, the Lake began to increase, and rose fifteen palmi' before the year 1787, when it sunk to nearly its former level. From 1806 to 1816, the most formidable inundation record took place: the superficies of the Lake was twenty palmi higher than at the greatest increase of 1780-7. The peninsula of Ortucchio became an island; the water rose above the altar of the church; and great destruction of property took place there, as Avezzano itself remained but twenty¬ well as at Trasacco and Luco. seven palmi above the Lake: and the year 1816 will always be remem¬ bered as one of terror and distress to the inhabitants of the district. From that time the Lake went down forty-seven palmi in the space of nineteen years; so that land, which was under water in the years 1670, 1740, and 1780, stood thirteen palmi above it in 1835.“ At present, the Lake is again on the increase, though very slowly. the Lake is again on the increase, though very slowly.

Here all the scenery grows more wild and Swiss in character: vistas between mountains displayed crags with towns perched thereon; and clouds, covering many of the higher points, lent a mystery to what was beyond. Celano,' once an important fortress-town, and the head of the Marsica during the troublous times of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, is now remarkable only for the extreme picturesqueness of its situation: it stands below a wondrous bare precipice on a hill overlooking the whole of the Lake of Fucino, though at a considerable distance from its edge; the space between the town and the water being filled with meadows and vineyards, and watered the town and the water being filled with meadows and vineyards, and watered by the clearest streams. (See PLATE VI.) The history of Celano possesses a great deal of interest; and the life of one of its Countesses, Covella, would alone furnish romance enough for a one of its Countesses, Covella, would alone furnish romance enough for a volume.

But as, in 1430, a son of Lo¬ renzo Colonna, Count of Alba and Celano, was made Duke of Amalfi by Queen Giovanna II.) it is most probable the castle is of Colonna origin. Celano subsequently passed into the hands of the Orsini, who enjoyed it with Amalfi until their possessions were bestowed, in 1461, by Ferdinand I. on the Piccolomini, who retained both until 1584, when Giovanni Piccolomini, the last Duke of Amalfi, sold it.“ How the Peretti obtained Celano, I do not know; nor who ruled it after the disturbances of Massaniello in 1647, when the town rebelled and was severely punished.“ The last owner of this beautiful place died a few years since intestate; and the property is now in a decaying state, while numerous heirs-at-law are contesting its possession.

Thus at length we reached Solmona (See PLATE IX.), which stands on an elevated ridge, between two small rivers, the courses of which are marked by thick poplars. A ruined church, a rent wall, a leaning house, or a tower out of draw¬ ing, speak of the earthquakes which have so frequently desolated this inter¬ esting spot, well known as the birth-place of Ovid, and still, after many sieges and other calamitous vicissitudes, a fine city. We admired its well¬ paved streets and numerous shops, (half of which seemed confectioners', for the confectionery of Solmona is famous all over Italy,) its cafés, palazzi, and churches, as we passed along the principal thoroughfare, and made our way to the great deserted convent, or hospital, now used as the inn. The inte¬ rior, however, of that refuge was so uninviting, that we resolved to go on eight or nine miles further to Popoli, only resting our horses for an hour; a duty which we accomplished for them in a vast stable, full of mules, the jingling of whose bells was distracting: meanwhile, we rambled over the city, and indulged in Limonata at various cafés. There are many objects of interest in Solmona: the Market-place with its picturesque aqueduct, overlooked by a beautiful Gothic arch, the remains of a Church which fell in the last century; the great Church of Sant' Annunziata; a Church which fell in the last century; the great Church of Sant' Annunziata; the Cathedral of San Pamfilo; and several Gothic doors and windows in the Cathedral of San Pamfilo; and several Gothic doors and windows in various parts of the city.

Perhaps the earthquakes in the last century may have completed the work of desolation; since Alberti, in 1596, writes, “ Si veggono molte rovine di grand editci; and other authors speak as if there had been more witnesses of past grandeur than exist at present. The Church of San Pelino (a building worth the attention of architects, of which the only notice I can find relates to its the attention of architects, of which the only notice I can find relates to its restoration by a Bishop Giovanni in 1081)' stands by the side of these ruins, and, together, they form a group whose grand solitary character cannot fail to strike the traveller. (See PLATE XI.) Corfinium may have existed as à name until the tenth century;' but during the Lombards, and theil county or Gastaldato of Balva, it seems to have disappeared. We lingered long by these classic remains, and returned by the hot valley of the Sagit- taria, whose banks were blackened by droves of recumbent pigs, to our abode at Popoli July 31st, 1843. We set off by day-break, in order that we might reach Chieti (the capital of Abruzzo Citeriore, distant twenty-one miles from Popoli) before the heat of the day; a project which we were not to execute.

Having no Carta di Passo for this division, we were stopped forthwith, and only allowed to di Passo for this division, we were stopped forthwith, and only allowed to proceed on showing the letters we bore, and on promising to escape from the tabooed territory as soon as we could. We re-crossed the Pescara, therefore, and were once more on the high-road to Chieti; but the great heat of the day, combined with the little interest possessed by the scenery, made the journey far from a pleasant one. Nor did the high clay ridge, on which Chieti stood afar off, offer any recompense in perspective. Long indeed it was before we arrived at the gates of the capital of Abruzzo Citeriore, by apparently endless windings of monotonous, though good, carriage-road : the ascent to this ancient city, (formerly Teate of the Marru¬ cini,2) is truly “ un vero Calvario.\" The view from the summit of the hill is extensive and magnificent in the extreme ; yet, excepting perhaps the group of mountains about the Gran Sasso,—that which terminates the fine chain bounding the plain to the right,—the whole scene has little attraction for a landscape-painter, from its extreme panoramic vastness.

What is worse, they will not let you pay for the whole, which one would willingly do; for that, say they, would be unjust to after-comers, who have a right to hire unoccupied beds. Fortunately, we were the only strangers in the Locanda, so we slept in our six beds accordingly; a repose we were not sorry to have after an early dinner. Our evening passed in procuring food for our horses, (no very easy matter,) and in wandering about the city, which, after all, had no great charms for us; and we left the promenade on the ramparts, thinking, that were we never to see Chieti again, we should not be exceedingly sorry. We also delivered a letter of introduction to the Marchese San Giovanni, Intendente of the province, a very agreeable person ; who, at our request, procured a letter for us to an inhabitant of Civita di Penna, where we intended to halt the following night.

Its modern associations of interest may be summed up shortly: it recalls the death of the celebrated commander Sforza, who was drowned while crossing the river in 1423 ; and it gave the title of Marchese di Pescara to D’Avalos, the husband of Vittoria Colonna. After bathing in the Adriatic, and deciding—on having explored its envi¬ rons — that Pescara was to us utterly unprofitable, saving a distant view of the Gran Sasso, in combination with its long walls, and its flat, sandy fore¬ ground, we returned in our caratella to Chieti ; and that city, after a dinner and siesta at mezzodi, we left with but little regret early in the after¬ noon ; first purchasing some capital straw-hats, which they make better in the province of Teramo than anywhere else. Once more down the tiresome hill of Chieti, and to the banks of the broad Pescara, over which we passed in a ferry-boat, and took our course by rather indistinct tracks towards the Gran Sasso, in the vicinity of which great mountain stands Cività di Penna. All the country we passed is a weary monotony of undulations: a path leads up a long clay hill sprinkled with vines and a few trees, and at its top you hail the distant Gran Sasso, and dream you may go on plain ground for an hour or so; when, lo! down you drop into a valley, with a dawdling stream or perhaps the dry bed of a torrent at its bottom, a cottage or two overlooking its winding way; a torrent at its bottom, a cottage or two overlooking its winding way; having overcome all of which, you commence climbing path No. 2, up a clay hill exactly resembling No. 1; and this occurs so perpetually, and without a shade of variety, that a journey in the neighbourhood of Chieti is of a most tread-mill nature. At every ascent the Gran Sasso seems to stand on a plain, though these tantalizing ridges and ravines prevent your having any view but that from the top of each successive hill. All around one sees towns, though none apparently of great beauty; and we passed one sees towns, though none apparently of great beauty; and we passed Pianello and Loretto, both of which, though possessing little picturesqueness in themselves, stand finely perched on their several ridges, and rejoice in a grand back-ground of the Monte Corno.

And, having sought the stable, it was so cold and damp, that one of our horses was instantly taken ill; and, as we could not persuade anybody to bring in food for them, we adjourned once more to the market-place, where we waited long, in vain, for any assistance :—this man had a stable, but had lost the key; another had some hay, but was gone to a neighbouring town:—and thus, these and other equally apropos suggestions were all we had to amuse us till the arrival of Don Andrea Giardini, the Mayor Syndic of the town, to whom mean¬ while I had applied.

Sleep, from the little we saw of our room, was not to be expected; and, to add to our sorrows, the police declared our passports out of all order, (not being Carte di Passo for the province,) although signed by the Governor of Chieti himself: so we the province,) although signed by the Governor of Chieti himself: so we had the choice given us of remaining at Città di Penna till an express could be received from Chieti at Città Sant' Angelo, the Capoluogo of the district, or of going back to Chieti ourselves.

Prisoners as we were, we resolved on changing our obnoxious abode; and our good genius the Syndic accordingly found us charming lodgings at the house of Signor Michelloni, a caffetiere, whose rooms and beds were unexceptionable. This was something: but, indignant with Città di Penna in general, and our acquaintances of last night in par¬ ticular, we retired to an adjacent convent, and passed the morning in ram¬ bling over its gardens, and sitting in a fig-tree, forming plans for the mor¬ row. A surprising dinner at midday augmented our esteem for the Syndic and Signor Michelloni, who supplied us most profusely with liqueurs, Rosolio, &amp;c., and Signor Michelloni, who supplied us most profusely with liqueurs, Rosolio, & for the manufacture of which Città di Penna is renowned. The Doctor of the town also sent his card, and an immense batter-pud¬ ding; by way, we supposed, (and not a bad way either,) of testifying his regret at our last night's reception. Towards evening we began our journey to Città Sant' Angelo, with the Syndic's groom as guide; a route of which I will only say, that it was a counterpart of that tread-mill of hill and hollow by which we had been victimized in our ride from Chieti. The hills were full of chasms and cracks; hideous clay ridges, ungraced by a shrub, or even a rock, or a pebble; and the hollows contained rivers; after fording the last of which, the moon rose the hollows contained rivers; after fording the last of which, the moon rose and lighted us on, by tedious mule-tracks, to Città Sant' Angelo, (supposed the ancient Angulus' of the Vestini,) where we arrived when all men were fast asleep. Not having had any rest during the previous night, we were pretty well tired, and glad to exchange the continual feeling of being about to fall off our horses down an unknown depth, for that of reposing in the kitchen of an Osteria, whose good-natured Oste we knocked up. Moreover, K. disco¬ vered some very good-looking sausages: so we had them cooked, and made a very comfortable supper by the aid of whiskey and water, the wine being undrinkable. August 3, 1843.

The Sub-governor also gave us some excellent coffee, and invited us to his country-house ; a politeness we were obliged to decline, as directly after our interview we recommenced our travels on the treadmill, and were at Signor Michelloni's once more before noon.

We wished our friend the Syndic good-bye with regret, but had none for Città di Penna, which we left about two o'clock in the afternoon, rather gladly than otherwise. We went straight up the face of the mountain to a little village, Monte¬ bello, whence the view was vast and map-like, but by no means beautiful. A long and steep ascent succeeded, which we climbed on foot gaily enough, for the air was fresh at that great height. But alas for poor Gridiron ! who for the air was fresh at that great height. But alas for poor Gridiron ! who fell suddenly lame from some unknown cause, and sadly destroyed my pleasure by his uneasy progress thenceforward. After a great toil to the summit, we struck into dark paths through wide beech forests broken by gray rocks, whence, at intervals, the view of the Gran Sasso, rising above an unbroken distance of wood, was infinitely grand.

As for me, I walked all day, not being able to keep awake on my horse. At Rocca San Stefano, a helpless-looking town, sticking against a mourn- fully bare hill-side, some respectable people hailed us from a large house near the road, and insisted on our refreshing ourselves and horses; so I should not have said that the day was destitute of its white mark. These good people regaled us with biscuits and Limonata, and pressed us very much to stay; but we preferred spinning out our disagreeable thread all at once : so down we went, and up and down again, all hideousness and sirocco, to Barisciano, whence, to make bad worse, we had to follow the high-road to Aquila, twelve or fourteen miles of dust, and ineffable stupidity. Indeed, 1 was mightily disappointed in the Valley of Aquila, which, although full of cultivation, (more particularly of almond-trees,) is of so great a width as to be more like a plain ; and its sides are enclosed by bleak, bare mountains, not very striking in form, though grand from their loftiness. Aquila itself, once so important a city, and yet holding its place as capital of the pro¬ vince of Abruzzo Ulteriore Secondo, stands on an eminence commanding the whole of the valley, and allowing a passage only for the river Aterno be¬ tween its base and the mountains on one side. To this hill you ascend by slow windings; and, when the city was in its palmy days, it must have : had an imposing appearance. Even now, the Castle overlooking all, the Cupola of San Bernardino, with various Campanili and Palazzi of a delicate¬ coloured stone, throw an air of magnificence over the first approach.

Aquila, however, can boast of one advan¬ tage unknown to its more prosperous fellow-city Chieti, namely, a really good inn: “ Il Sole\" might do credit to any place in southern Europe, and in its spacious chambers we were right glad to repose. Most authorities agree that- Aquila was founded by Conrad in 1254: some antiquarians make the Emperor Frederic II. its first originator; while others affirm it to have been an existing city in the time of the Lom¬ bards, and only enlarged by Frederic.\" All agree that the union of the fugitive population of the ancient cities of Amiternum, Forcona, Foruli, &amp;c. fugitive population of the ancient cities of Amiternum, Forcona, Foruli, & whose sites are in its immediate neighbourhood, was the first cause of the rise of the modern city: nor does the well-established fact of Conrad having granted it privileges, &amp;c. at all preclude its having had an existence having granted it privileges, & at all preclude its having had an existence long previously. Its name is most frequently supposed to be an allusion to the Imperial Eagle, under whose support it was first brought into power, to the Imperial Eagle, under whose support it was first brought into power, as a check to the Roman Pontiffs, on the very borders of their dominions.

Nicola dell' Isola seems to have been an extraordinary man; for two envoys, sent by King Charles II. (one his own son) to punish the offender, returned to Naples with a full conviction of the integrity of his conduct: a persuasion, however, which may have been not a little enforced by the champion of Aquila himself at the head of his six thousand men. The city was constantly torn by internal dissensions during the interregnum of the Popes, and the absence of Charles II. in 1292; but peace and order of the Popes, and the absence of Charles II. in 1292; but peace and order reigned, for once, during the short time that Pope Celestine V. wore the tiara, during which he resided in Aquila.

After the death of Giovanna II., until 1441, when Alfonso conquered the whole of the kingdom, and when there was a short interval of quiet, discord seems to have claimed Aquila as her favourite abode. Rebel¬ lions in 1460, the war of the Barons in 1484, the expedition of Charles VIII. of France (for whom the Aquilani openly declared), are among the principal events affecting Aquila until the possession of the Regno by the Spanish dynasty; events each fraught with years of disturbance and misery. à « Camponesco si adalte alle circonstanze,' says Antinori, vol. i.

During the rest of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries Aquila seems to have been fast sinking to that secondary position which it now holds : nor is it worth while to record more of its history in detail. In 1703° a most fearful earthquake occurred throughout the Abruzzi, from the 14th to the 21st of January, and great part of Aquila was again reduced to ruins: two thousand four hundred persons perished by the falling of houses in the city alone, and great numbers were wounded; above twenty thousand persons perished within the province. After this weary list of plague, famine, earthquake, oppression, internal discord, and rebellion, one wonders rather to see Aquila as flourishing as it now is, than that it should not be more so. Nor has the history of cen¬ turies brought wisdom to the inmates of this unfortunate city; for it is but à very few years ago that fresh conspiracies and disturbances provoked the anger of the Government, and were the cause of several of its noblest palaces being at this day tenantless. Thus much by way of history of Aquila the fallen. The Intendente or Governor of Aquila, to whom we had a letter of intro- duction, was at the Baths of Antrodoco, for the benefit of his health : so we occupied our afternoon in a stroll about the city, which afforded plenty of amusement in the variety of bits of. Gothic architecture of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; doors, windows, &amp;c. presenting themselves at every fourteenth centuries; doors, windows, & presenting themselves at every step. Few towns, indeed, possess more interesting studies for an architect. The quiet loneliness of the place had also its charms for us; and we re¬ turned with favourable impressions of Aquila to our inn, close to whosé gate stands the Tower of Margaret of Austria’s palace. In passing through several of the streets we were struck by the harmo¬ nious singing or chanting of the workmen—blacksmiths and others—at their labour. Giustiniani. Geo. Baglivi, p. 25. "

The town itself has a very Swiss look ; or rather resembles one at the foot of the Alps, on the Italian side. It contains no object of interest, and is sufficiently gloomy when “ i bagnanti\" are all gone: its Castle, now a ruin, frowns in decay, from a huge rock imme¬ diately above the clustered dwellings.

The valley of the Velino is much wider beyond the little town of Pa- terno, (believed to be the ancient Cutilia,) and the flat waste near the river is full of the most curious mineral springs, forming numerous little lakes.

Great was the tumult in the narrow street where the Intendente had lodged: the arrangement of his luggage—the soothing and menacing of eccentric mules and perverse horses¬ the collecting together all his Excellency’s suite of domestics—the simultaneous the collecting together all his Excellency’s suite of domestics—the simultaneous drinking of coffee at the last moment—and the noisy adieux of the Antrodo- chesi spectators. How many saddles were found to be inverted, just as they should have been on their bearers backs! How much string was required to tie on irregular articles of baggage ! And how many times all the horses, mules, asses, luggage, grooms, guides, and spectators were involved in the wildest confusion, by some sudden freak of one or two ungovernable quadrupeds! These are matters only to be guessed at by those who have sojourned in Italy. At length we were in order : the Secretary and the Judge on very forlorn- looking mules; the cook and all the male household, with most elaborate ac¬ companiments of food and utensils, on creatures of every description; and the Maestro di Cavalleria, with a mounted groom leading Prince Giardinellis gray horse, and two others on little animals as ugly as vicious, (with no tails, and eves a long way out of their heads,) dignified by the title of Pomeranian ponies, and intended for the use of Donna Caterina. As for me, 1 had a very decent black horse, with a most uneasy saddle, the stirrups appertaining to which gave way in about a quarter of an hour, and rolled hopelessly down the ravine. Behind came the gend'armes, with guides and baggage-mules; and a highly-picturesque cavalcade we were, however our appointments might want the full dignity to be looked for in a Governor’s establishment. Slowly we wound up the pass as far as Rocca di Corno, where we halted for about an hour (though to what purpose I have not the faintest idea) ; and then, having proceeded two or three miles further on the Aquila road, we struck into a mule-track leading to the right. For the last part of our route we had varied the sleepy monotony of our progress by a trot or canter along the good highway; but, as we began to ascend a wild and steep mountain, we gradually resumed our sedate single line, except the wretched little Pome¬                                  "

It occupied a weary while in the glaring heat of the day to conquer this mountain; and when we did so (except à short glimpse of the wall-like range of the Gran Sasso), there was nothing to répay us for our trouble : a long and tiresome plain of undulating ground, with no one spot prettier or more remarkable than another. At noon we halted for repose and repast in a ruined tenuta, or cattle-shed. There is always much fun in the wild roughing character of this kind of expedition; and the excellent cold mutton, bread, and onions, were by no means the worse for being eaten off the top of a barrel, our seats being the trunk of a tree. Our wine, alas ! was that wretched vino cotto—equally un¬ palatable and unvholesome; for, little as I drank of it, there being no water- 1 paid a dear penalty in the shape of a headache. In the afternoon we again set off, most of the party complaining bitterly of fatigue, and not the least sympathising with my admiration of the beauty of the views, which, as we descended, opened into yellow plains fringed with fine oak-woods, stretching avay on all sides at the foot of the magnificent Marsic mountains, for we had how entered the old territory of the Marsi, Our road wound through one of these forests, and below the picturesque town of Corbara del Conte; whence, leaving on our right the distant Turano. whose towers were glowing in the setting sun, we made for Sant Anatolia, à neat-looking little village, where we were to pass the night. All this part of the Abruzzi abounds with very ancient remains, and the sites of several of the Abruzzi abounds with very ancient remains, and the sites of several cities of the Aborigines of Italy are fixed by antiquaries in these valleys.

I fell into a comfortable sleep; and when I avoke, the rest of our cavalcade had arived in a state of great fatigué, and were employed in drinking cold water with spirit of aniseed, administered to them by a varlety of hospitable old women without shoes or stockings. Soon after the Placidi family appeared—a very striking groupe, composed of a most venerable old lady, 98 years of age, whose long white hair fell on of a most venerable old lady, 98 years of age, whose long white hair fell on her shoulders, and two sons, both upwards of 70, and in appearance as old as their mother, who called them efancialli miei\" and efgliuolini.\" By these good people we were taken to the Palazzo Placidi—a huge, rambling old house, with gloomy, dirty state-rooms, full of ancient furniture arranged round the walls, damask sofas and leather chairs, and tables with gilded legs, none the walls, damask sofas and leather chairs, and tables with gilded legs, none of them apparently having been in use since the days of the early Sicoli of them apparently having been in use since the days of the early Sicoli Kings, of whose names D. F. Martelli obligingly gives a list from Shem downwards. The emptiness of rooms in these Palazzi, the absence of books, needle-work, or any of the little signs of mental occupation so constant in our own homes, is always observable, and to an English feeling gives an air of chill and discomfort far from agrecable. Nothing could be more hospitable or well supplied than the supper-table, which we were glad to join. Donna Serafina de’ Placidi was a wondrous old lady, in full possession of all her faculties, and conversing while she knitted with great assiduity. A chaotic-looking chamber was shown me as mine for the night, containing a vast bed, with crimson velvet about it enough for three such; on which I was glad to repose in my cloak, seeing that its comfort and propriety were wholly external. August 17th, 1843. We were roused long before day, and sent on our way coffeeless,—an unusual circumstance in Italy, where, though nobody eats until later in the day, the morning “ tazza di cafè\" is seldom omitted. Having visited the chapel of Sant' Anatolia, our cavalcade wound through cool and plea¬ sant woods for an hour or two; and after passing through the town of San Donato, we descended to Tagliacozzo. Very little allegria prevailed in our party, and the general horror lest their steeds should break into the smallest trot showed that some inconvenience was the result of the previous day's                                 "

We entered Tagliacozzo from below (see PLATE II.), and found a great change in its appearance from that which it bore at my visit in July. The green before the town was covered with people preparing for the fair held there, and the houses were all more or less decorated in honour of this great festa of the Madonna, (called la Madonna dell' Oriente, from a pic¬ ture of the Virgin, supposed to be of Eastern workmanship,) which is held but once in a century, and consequently with great pomp and expenditure. All round the Piazza a temporary colonnade had been built; and in the centre à very pretty Gothic chapel of ornamented wood, in which the painting of the Madonna was placed, no church in Tagliacozzo being of sufficient size to accommodate the multitude expected. In this chapel the Bishop of Solmona (the Bishop of the Marsi, in whose diocese Tagliacozzo is situated, being absent,) was to officiate at High Mass. On all sides were fixed poles and all sorts of ironworks for illuminations, and the very fountain was dried and turned into a depôt for fireworks, while the crowds of people arriving at every instant betokened how well the fête would be attended. We went immediately to the Palazzo Mastroddi, a fine house, built by the grandfather of the present proprietor;—a noble staircase, ornamented with antique fragments, inscriptions, and busts of remarkable men of the district leads to an excellent suite of rooms, perfectly clean, well kept, though thinly furnished, the largest of which contained a good piano-forte. Most of these rooms communicated with an extensive covered Loggia, built over the roofs of the adjacent houses, and looking into the Piazza, whose gay the roofs of the adjacent houses, and looking into the Piazza, whose gay white buildings, hung with red and blue tapestry, and backed by the high rocks of the pass and the deep blue sky, formed a charming scene. Choruses of sacred music were resounding through all these brilliant apartments, Cano- nice and amateur choristers rehearsing for to-morrow's display, as we met Don Filippo Mastroddi, the wealthy master of the mansion—a most agreeable and gentlemanlike person, who welcomed me very cordially, and showed me and gentlemanlike person, who welcomed me very cordially, and showed me to a quiet little bed-room, whose snugness and perfect nicety contrasted fa¬ vourably with the unclean magnificence of my last night's abode.

But there is seldom any presentation to the fair the same family mansion. But there is seldom any presentation to the fair part of the household; and the secondary position in society, held by those who are with us of the first importance, is a striking, and not over-agreeable, feature in the domestic economy in many of these country establishments. After dinner, Don Filippo shewed me some good specimens of Gothic win- dows in different parts of the town. We also went over an institution for the education of young ladies of the first families of the Marsica; it was the education of young ladies of the first families of the Marsica; it was founded by the Mastroddi family, and is under the immediate management of three Sisters of Charity.

To those who have no idea of an Italian fête, a description of that I witnessed here may be amusing; and the details of one will suffice for the whole three days of its duration. Sup¬ pose yourself, therefore, in the Casa Mastroddi at sun-rise; a cup of coffee is brought to you in your own room, (a biscuit also if you ask for it, is brought to you in your own room, (a biscuit also if you ask for it, though the natives do not indulge in anything so like a breakfast,) or you go to seek your café in the room of Donna Caterina, the stepmother of the two brothers Mastroddi, who continually labours to fill little cups, which are dispersed by her domestics all over the mansion. Then you wander into the large room, and into the great Loggia, where you find the ladies into the large room, and into the great Loggia, where you find the ladies and officers walking about in parties, or listening to the bands of music and officers walking about in parties, or listening to the bands of music incessantly performing below the window. The Piazza is like a scene in a theatre, all hung with crimson and gold draperies and tapestry from win¬ dow and door, and crowded with people, the constant hum of the multi- tude filling up the pauses between the music. About eleven, a stir takes place among the magnates of the house: everybody comes forth full-dressed. and the Intendente, (with his staff, in full uniform,) and all the company and the Intendente, (with his staff, in full uniform,) and all the company following, walk through lines of military to the temporary chapel, where the Bishop of Solmona officiates at High Mass. A friar having preached a Latin sermon of most painful duration, the Prince and the Mastroddi party return to the palacé in the same order and state; the gay colours, and the brilliant light of summer over the whole procession making it a very spark- ling scene. Nor should I omit, that the dress of a Neapolitan Bishop (a bright-green satin hat, amethyst-coloured silk robes lined with scarlet, gold chain and cross, with lilac stockings,) is in itself a world of glitter. Then, between the “ fonzioni' and “pranzo,' we all went,—one day, to make a call of ceremony on some grandees of the town ;—or, on another, we attended of ceremony on some grandees of the town ;—or, on another, we attended the Bishop and the Prince to the foundation school, where we earnestly in- the Bishop and the Prince to the foundation school, where we earnestly in- spected samplers and artificial flowers, made by the prettiest set of little girls possible, the Bishop noticing all with a kindness of manner that shewed the old gentleman's heart was full of good feelings.

            "65 To one whose greatest horror is noise, this sort of life was not ’a little wearving; but having been informed that to leave the house during the festa would be considered as the greatest insult to the family, I felt obliged to remain, and resigned me to my fête accordingly. Next came the dinner: the company in the Palazzo Mastroddi now amounted to above sixty persons, (not including servants,) and I confess to being somewhat amazed, much as I had heard of Abruzzo hospitality, at the scale on which these entertainments were conducted. A gay scene it was; and I always had the pleasure of getting a place by some one of the ladies of the company; a piece of good fortune I owed to my being the only of the company; a piece of good fortune I owed to my being the only foreigner present, for a dark mass of my superiors in rank— Generals, Judges, &amp;c., were obliged to sit together, unilluminated by any of the lights Judges, & were obliged to sit together, unilluminated by any of the lights of Creation. Immediately after dinner, the suite of rooms and Loggia were thronged by conversing groups, and coffee was handed amongst them. A novel pic¬ ture was that festive Piazza, alive with thousands of loiterers, (there were said to be more than ten thousand visitors at this fête, besides the towns¬ people,) listening to the Chieti and Tagliacozzo bands playing alternately, By this time the sun was sinking, and everybody sallied forth to the promenade outside the town, where platforms were erected to observe the horse-races, which shortly took place, and about which great interest was shown. The winning horse was taken up to the chapel of the Madonna dell'Oriente, and led to the steps of the altar, by way, I suppose, of expressing that a spirit of thankfulness may be graceful and proper upon all occasions. And after the race, a fire-balloon should have ascended; but somehow or other there was a reigning destiny adverse to balloons, for the first caught fire, and blazed away before it left earth; the second stuck in a tree, where it shared the same fate; and the largest ran erroneously among chimney¬ pots, and was consumed on the house-tops, to the great disgust of the Tag¬ liacozzesi. Now followed an invitation from Madame Mancini, or some one else who possessed a house in the Piazza, in order to see the girandola or fireworks; so away we went, (the Intendente leading the way,) and ate ices in the draped galleries overlooking the square. This was about Ave Maria, or later, and I K "

Crack—bounce—whizz! the scene was changed in a twinkling by the flash and explosion of all kinds of fireworks; rockets flying hither and thither, serpents and explosion of all kinds of fireworks; rockets flying hither and thither, serpents rushing and fizzing all round the colonnades, and that which should have been the fountain blazing away in streams of fire. Again a movement, and the point of interest is changed: a long line of people is bending towards the theatre, and threading with difficulty the groups of peasants already composing themselves to sleep. As soon as our party ar¬ rived the performance began, and great fun we had between the acts of the Opera, in laughing at the strange dresses of some of the personages from neigh- bouring towns, who displayed fashions unchanged, said the Tagliacozzesi, since the last century's festa. One charming old lady, with a rose-coloured satin bonnet, at least four feet in diameter, and a blue and yellow fan to match, was the delight of the whole audience. It was past midnight ere we returned, by bright moonlight, through the quiet Piazza, thronged with the same multitude of peasants, who had been unable to find shelter in the over-filled accommodation of the town Locande and Osterie, and now lay buried in sleep. Many of the groups of mothers and families, with the broken silver rays falling on them through the gothic arches of the little temple, were picturesque and touching beyond description. To all these events add a very merry supper, and a late going to repose, and such was the routine of three days, the varieties of processions, visits to adjacent villas, &amp;c., excepted. Annoyed, as I had been, at the prospect of such adjacent villas, & excepted. Annoyed, as I had been, at the prospect of such waste of time, I confess to having been pretty well reconciled to it by the kindness and amiable disposition of every one with whom I was brought in contact, and the unbroken cheerfulness with which every moment was filled up. The concluding events of the last days of the fête must, however, yet be related; which, though only occasioning great confusion, might have had very sad results.

            "67 Great was the confusion, and on gaining the narrow street, the scene was terrible: an immense body of flame was rising behind the old Ducal Palace, and dense volumes of smoke obscured the moon. The fire had not yet reached the building, but must inevitably do so unless speedily checked, as the offices of the Institution immediately communicated with an extensive maga zine (or fenile) of straw, whose contents had been burning internally for some time before the flames burst forth, and led to the alarm being given. To rescue the children was the first object, and great good feeling and promptitude were manifested on all sides. As soon as the terrified females¬ most of them carried straight from their beds to various adjacent houses, were out of danger, and the furniture moved to the street, every one did his best towards the extinction of the fire,—no easy matter, since no water was within reach; and the only method adopted was, to unroof that part of the fenile, nearest the Palazzo, and smother the flames as far as possible with continual baskets of earth, until the rooms joining the premises to the burning barn could be destroyed, to prevent the further spread of the conflagration. This was a long operation, though many men were immediately pressed into the Meanwhile service, and commenced the work of demolition with rapidity. we were all marshalled into companies, and set to work in a garden to fill tubs we were all marshalled into companies, and set to work in a garden to fill tubs and baskets with earth, which were handed, when full, to the top of the wall and baskets with earth, which were handed, when full, to the top of the wall of the unroofed fenile, where lines of men threw their contents out on the of the unroofed fenile, where lines of men threw their contents out on the burning fuel.

I could hardly help thinking, that the origin of all this might be sought for in the fireworks of the evening; the origin of all this might be sought for in the fireworks of the evening;                                    "

I took leave with regret of the kind Mastroddi family, all the members of which are most lively and amiable, and Don Filippo himself a person of cultivated mind and considerable attainments. Nor was I allowed to depart without great invitations to prolong my stay, for they informed me that for at least a week their most intimate friends would remain the house, and the dancing and festivities of those days would be all the more desirable, as they would be less encumbered by state would be all the more desirable, as they would be less encumbered by state and ceremony. I regretted also the little chance I had of again meeting with the Coletti family, agreeable and well-informed people, although they also cordially invited me to their house at Tufo in the Marsica. My next destination was to Magliano, to the house of Don Giambattista (or, called for shortness, Don Tita,) Masciarelli, one of the richest persons in the Abruzzi, to whom I had a letter of recommendation from M. le Chevalier Kestner.“ Thither, accordingly, I went in his carriage, which had been sent to Tagliacozzo to bring back the youngest of his two sons, Don Gregorio, who had been present at the festa. Poor Don Gregorio Mascia¬ relli is an intelligent young man, about twenty years of age, although so diminutive as to appear a boy of ten or twelve. Unable to move a step, having become lame from a fall during his infancy, he is always cheerful ; and though outwardly deprived of pleasure, the balance of happiness may be in his favour in a capacity for self-improvement, and a variety of resources known to few of the more healthy: his days pass in reading, or quiet games, or in studying the flute, violin, and piano ; and he is no contemptible performer in drawing.

(See PLATE XVI.) clean, every house in good order and repair, while the piazza, one of whose sides is formed by the Masciarelli Palace, is the perfection of feudal propriety and quiet. I believe there is no authentic record of the existence of Magliano before A.D. 1350,» although it is said by some to occupy the site of an ancient town—Mallianum : possibly, it has originated like Massa, Capelle, and other neighbouring villages, in the dispersion of the population of Alba. Its walls and fortifications are owing to a Cardinal Colonna, during the wars of that family with the Orsini. Don Tita Masciarelli, my new host, is one of the most important pro¬ prietors of the Marsica: the fertile estates of Paterno, on the banks of the Lake of Fucino,—the territory around Magliano and the valley nearly to Sant' Anatolia, are all possessed by him, or shared by his younger brother Don Vin¬ cenzo, who resides in a Casino nearer Monte Velino. Don Tita himself is the picture of plain but hearty friendliness and sincerity, and has a well culti¬ vated mind. He goes but little from his estates, the care of which is his great hobby; and he feels a just pride in his model town of Magliano, of which he is as it were the little monarch. His Palace, as might be expected from its owner, is all neatness and arrangement, with a quiet air of solidity and somewhat of luxury throughout : witness the rooms I occupied during my stay,—the sitting apartment of which was thoroughly well furnished, and the carpetted bedroom, containing its four-post bed with chintz hangings, opening into a capital little dressing-room, full of all the usual requisites and comforts. I could have fancied myself in old England.

Bears as well as Brigands have ceased to exist in these quiet districts. I remained three days at Magliano, never annoyed in any instance by officious attentions, but treated with the most simple and cordial warmth of hospitality. One morning I employed in sketching (from the Piazza of Mag¬ liano) the view of Campi Valentini towards the mountains of the Liris, a beautiful prospect, and memorable from the battle fought near Alba, between Charles I. of Anjou, and Corradino. In fancy, I could picture the long lines of the women of Aquila, who at sunrise on the 28th August A.D., 1268,“ were seen descending the hills to the camp of the French, bearing provisions on their heads. Another morning I was lionized by my excellent host, over his farm near Sant' Anatolia, and could not but be struck by the extreme good management and flourishing condition of everything. I fear I fell in his esteem as he ascertained by numerous questions my profound ignorance of agricultural mat¬ ters—threshing-machines, rates of labour, stock, cattle, &amp;c.; but I did my ters—threshing-machines, rates of labour, stock, cattle, & but I did my best in admiring all I saw, which I believe would have been of the greatest interest to an English farmer. Two afternoons I devoted to visiting Alba, the ancient Alba Fucinensis, which stands on a double hill, about two miles only from Magliano, though the walk thither across the plain, covered with stones, is as fatiguing as treble the distance on a decent road. The great heat prevented one from setting out early, and to return by Ave Maria allows so little time, that I could not, as I wished, obtain drawings of the old walls, (among the most remarkable in Italy,) but gave my short visits to the choice and execution of views which appeared to me most picturesquely characteristic of the general situation of the old city.

Of the hills which it formerly covered in its days of splendour, one now con¬ tains the solitary church of San Pietro, a building of high interest to the antiquary and architect, and which has been fully described by Valery, K. Craven, &amp;c.:—the adjacent eminence bears all which now represents Alba,- a sorry street of decayed houses. Below these are vast remains of the walls, a sorry street of decayed houses. Below these are vast remains of the walls, formed of gigantic stones, the oldest but least changed records of its past greatness. Long after the fall of the Roman Empire, Alba Fucinensis appears to have been a strong fortress, and perhaps suffered comparatively little from the in¬ roads of barbarians until the invasion of the Saracens in the ninth and tenth centuries. In 742 its territory was conquered by Trasmondo, Duke of Spoleto, and was afterwards divided between the monasteries of Farfa and Casauria.» In 1100, it was held out against Pope Pasquale II. and. Roger II. of Sicily,\" by the anti-pope Clement III., who was finally expelled II. of Sicily,\" by the anti-pope Clement III., who was finally expelled and retired to the mountains, where, says Corsignani,\" he died of hunger. —“ co ’denti della disperazione lacerato e divorato.\" Until the sixteenth cen¬ tury, when Fra. L. Alberti speaks of Alba as “ luogo abbandonato e rovinato, it was possessed by the Orsini and Colonna. The total fall of Alba may, however, be placed to the account of Charles I. of Anjou, who destroyed the city, and punished the inhabitants severely for their adherence to Corradino.e Thenceforward, it has only existed as a shadow. To a land scape painter its truly majestic situation, backed by Monte Velino, is worth many visits; and on account of its ancient and more modern associations, it is one of the most interesting spots in the Abruzzi provinces. During another afternoon I made an excursion over hot fields of Gran Turco, or Indian corn, to Scurcola, a town containing one thousand five hundred inhabitants, at whose summit stands a ruined castle of the Colonna, and the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, the successor of the Celestine Monastery founded by Charles I. of Anjou, after his victory in 1268.

After this hospitable interlude, I began to scale the great wall of mountain which confines the Val di Roveto down to Balzorano and Sora; and this was no light undertaking towards nine o’clock on an August morning.

Far below my feet, though yet high above the valley of Roveto, through which the Liris glides, lay the town of Civita D’Antino; and a long descent through splendid forests of beech brought me to its level. A feeling of dreari- ness, of which I can give no idea, pervades the surrounding scenery. Opposite were the savage crests of Serra di Sant Antonio, (whose deep recesses shelter a considerable waterfall,); and, as far as eye can reach, the Vale of the Liris closed on each side by long lines of solemn moun- the Vale of the Liris closed on each side by long lines of solemn moun- tains, of an indescribably stern and gloomy character, clad to their summits with thick forests, which, until within the last quarter of a century, bears with thick forests, which, until within the last quarter of a century, bears were not uncommonly known to inhabit. Civita D’Antino, a wild and scattered place, has a poetical and sullen grandeur in its aspect, as if it were altogether out of the world of life: no other dwellings are in sight, and its own bear the stamp of desolate and melancholy antiquity. The present town, containing about twelve hundred inhabitants, occupies but a small portion of the extensive site of the ancient city, the capital of the Antinates,\" the remains of which are here and there to be traced by the Antinates,\" the remains of which are here and there to be traced by fragments of cyclopean architecture. This spot has been more frequently visited than most of the towns of this region, vide Sir R. C. Hoare,) K. Craven, &amp;c.: and good accounts of it may be read in their works. (See PLATES XIX. and XX.) I easily found the spacious palace of Don Antonio Ferrante, a wealthy man, and the great proprietor of the district. Don Antonio was absent; but although I had no introduction beyond a simple request for a night's shelter, I was well received as if I had been travelling with a suite of domestics, and shewn to a handsome and clean room in the most friendly manner possible. And indeed, the comforts of the interior of Civita D’Antino are exceedingly striking, after the external appearance of the town: Sir R. C. Hoare's Classical Tour, i. 339.

August 29th, 1843. I passed the morning in drawing, though the magnitude of the mountain lines prevents Civita d'Antino from being easily transferred to paper; and some time was devoted to the ancient Cyclo¬ pean remains round the town. After our noon-day dinner I set off, (though much entreated to stay by these good people,) Don Manfredi accompanying me for two or three miles. A curious change of life had occurred to this young man: he had been educated at Naples, and was well accustomed to the gaieties of the metropolis: a short time since he had been called from the gaieties of the metropolis: a short time since he had been called from (what was in his case) the livelier position of a younger son to fulfil graver duties, as representative of his father, his elder brother having suddenly re¬ nounced all claim to his family property by becoming a Jesuit. I could not help thinking, from the remarks of Don Manfredi, that this prospect of riches and dignity seemed a poor compensation for loss of liberty; for the Abruzzese proprietor seldom quits his paternal estate : “ Siamo come i lupi, chiusi in queste montagne ; — said he, “ non vado pià in città. 1 wandered down to the river Liris, through a beautiful oak wood; dwelling much on the memory of such frequent hospitalities; such warm- hearted people; such primitive mountain homes.

But on arriving there, I found my friends had departed that morning, so I hurried down again, and went on to Pesco Canale and Capistrello, reaching Avezzano (by very hard walking,) at one hour of the night.

I could not resolve on leaving the neighbourhood of Capistrello without a sketch of its picturesque situation, so I réturned thither and drew, at early morn, though the walk back at noon over the Campi Valen¬ tini, a perfectly unsheltered plain, was rather a severe undertaking. Indeed I was well nigh knocked up by heat and thirst, and anxiously asked every pea¬ sant I met coming from the market of Avezzano, if they were carrying fruit or liquid of any sort : of course they had nothing but onions, pommi d'oro, eggs, or lambswool stockings. To my great joy, the last turn of the winding road over the mountain above the Emissario, divulged a dear old woman car¬ rying a huge water-melon, half of which she sold me for the sum of one grain, (less than a farthing,) and very refreshing it was. I regret not having seen or drawn the opening of the Emissario at Capistrello, which I believe is very picturesque. From Avezzano that afternoon, I hied me on foot to Celano, a place I longed much to examine; and the Sottintendente of the Distretto, Don Romeo Indelicato (as odd a name as any one may discover,) had obligingly, furnished me with a letter to one of the principal families of the town, the Tabassi.2 1 have already said so much of Celano, that little remains but to give some account of my new hosts and their family. The Tabassi are of Sol¬ mona origin, and they are spoken of in old books' as among the most ancient of that city. Their possessions are scattered over the Abruzzi: the eldest brother, Baron Tabassi, resides at Chieti; Stefano inhabits Pescina; Francesco has a fine house at Solmona; and Pamfilo lives in Celano with two unmarried sisters ; a third is a nun. 1 passed four days at Celano, Don Francesco and Don Pamfilo, Donna Costanza and Donna Felicetta, being then the occupants of the family house. These good people sought every opportunity to oblige and assist me; but left me to do just as I pleased with regard to my out-of-doors occupation. In T usually conveyed my luggage, consisting of two large carpet-bags, on a mule or ass, whose driver served as guide ;'and six carlines was the ordinary sum paid for a day’s march, with some¬ thing over and above for buona mano. But as my walks were frequently from twenty-five to thirty miles, I had of course to pay in proportion. Pachichelli, iii. 19.                                     "

Numbers of women were coming to the Piazza with wood from the high moun¬ tains above Gioja: most of them were from Lecce, and wore a very pretty cos¬ tume, a rarity throughout the Abruzzi, where the dress of the women is usu- ally very plain and common-place. The aprons of these damsels were of all colours and patterns, and worked by hand; but on no account would their owners either be drawn themselves, or sell any part of their dress, and they ran away and hid themselves if I only took a sketch-book from my pocket. The afternoon, when the weather became more serene, was passed in draw¬ ing quietly below the Mazarini Loggia, and about the town, amongst whose scattered outskirts many pretty studies might be found. In the evening there was a shoek of earthquake, but no damage resulted; and the bells of Pescina rang the usual alarm on these occasions, namely, three “ tocs\" of the Campana. September 7th, 1843. Most bitter pass of Pescina! How the chilling wind wailed between your bleak rocks, as I set off towards Scanno at sun¬ rise ! Surely the infant Mazarin must have been rheumatism-proof, since his natal mansion is more exposed than any in the town to the sweeping rush of cold air. Nor was I a whit less comfortless at having taken leave of my agreeable friend, Don Stefano Tabassi; nor did the prospect of a very dull and uninteresting journey, from the time I came out of the narrow passage of the stream to the valley of Ortona, at all mend the matter.

Ortona, below which I passed, is altogether unattractive and unworthy a second look, so I hastened on, and, leaving the road to Scanno on the left. proceeded to a village called San Sebastiano, where a French company have established an iron-foundry, to the agent of which D. Stefano Tabassi had given me a letter, not that the Ferrerià was an interesting subject to me, but everybody said I ought to see it. Indeed, most of the poor people about here seemed much excited about these iron-works; but as a company of speculators have lately settled themselves near the Maiella, with the intention of extracting sugar from potatoes, the simple peasantry make an odd jumble of the two different mestieri. “ Siete di quelli chi tirano lo zucchero dal ferro?\" said one, and “sarete della compagnia chi stanno a far la ferro con patate?\" was the question of another; (for a stranger is so rare an occur¬ rence in these wild districts, that he is sure to be set down as one of the iron-workers, or sugar-makers.) At San Sebastiano I fell in with Monsr. Richardon, the overseer of the new works, who informed me that his principal was absent, but invited me very heartily to join his colazione (to which he was then returning) and thereby I passed an hour very agreeably. Two or three of his lively coun¬ trymen had lately arrived from France, and entertained us by their horror of sundry omissions of cleanliness on the part of the aborigines of San Sebastiano, to which the older colonists seemed well broken in; but Monsr. Richardon recalled to their memory some village in Brittany, where, so far from soup¬ plates being only washed occasionally, the inhabitants substituted shallow holes cut in the wooden dinner-table, which communicated by channels with a perpetual tureen in the centre, into which the soup was poured, and diverged therefrom into each guest's plate or trough, to the great saving of trouble and earthenware After luncheon I followed my host to the new establishment, which is planted by a beautiful stream of water below a neighbouring village, the name of which I cannot recollect.

Richardon’s invitation to pass the night at San Sebastiano, as my time was portioned out ; so I pursued my route on a capital horse the good-natured man insisted on my taking to the top of the mountain, which is to be climbed before reaching Scanno. I had the greatest curiosity to see that town, having frequently heard of it from some of its inhabitants, who annually visit. Rome during the holy week, where their curious head-dress makes them easily distinguishable. From the summit of the long hills there is the loveliest possible bird's-eve view of the whole Lake of Fucino, lying in unbroken deep-blue in its circle of purple hills. I turned from that beautiful scene with regret, and commenced following my guide through a long beechwood, till the mountains and vale of Scanno burst on the view in all their dreary majesty; no vegetation ; no break in the hills to charm the eye with some milder scene beyond, but towering walls of bare rock, shivered into ravines, or formed by nature into gigantic buttresses, crowned with light gray crags and points against the dark- blue sky, and surrounding a long plain fully as barren as its confines. As 1 looked down on the desolate scene below me, a winding path among the great fragments of rock, with which this valley is thickly covered over, led my eye to the remotest part of it, where the dark indigo-coloured Lake of Scanno, with one bright building on its edge, and a fringe of trees at its upper extremity, lay solitary and gloomy in its mountain prison. At the end of a long descent I found myself opposite to the mournful little town of. Villalago, in passing which I caught a glimpse of a chasm, the Gole or Foce di Scanno, which might be drawn as the Poet's Inferno; the Gole or Foce di Scanno, which might be drawn as the Poet's Inferno; but my present way lay onward through the wild plain, whose appearance was by no means improved by a nearer investigation. by no means improved by a nearer investigation.

A wide, marshy plain, through which the river Sagittaria flows, and a tract of white stones were to be passed, until, on a considerable eminence, but shut out by enclosing mountains from any view but of the bleakest rocks immediately around, behold Scanno, a clean-looking town, with two or three Campanili and principal houses in a clean-looking town, with two or three Campanili and principal houses in prominent situations.

It is the prettiest thing in the world to see the children, who have beau- tiful faces, and are all turbaned, even as little babies. As for the women, they are decidedly the most beautiful race I saw in the Abruzzi: — their fresh and clear complexion, fine hair, good features, and sweet expression, are delightful: and owing to their occupation being almost entirely that of spinning wool, their faces have a delicacy, which their countrywomen who work in the their faces have a delicacy, which their countrywomen who work in the fields cannot lay claim to. Everything about Scanno is odd and quaint, and unlike any other Italian town, and the sight of every house, with its fair inmates spinning at the old- fashioned wheels before the doors, was very pleasant, as I passed up the well¬ paved streets to the house of the family, to- whom the Giudice of. Antrodocc had given me a letter of introduction. The inhabitants seemed particularly calm and silent, indulging little in that animated speech or action so charac- teristic of the people of the south. The whole population of the Abruzzi provinces, have, indeed, much more repose of manner than is usual with theil countrymen, and are a great contrast to their noisy brethren nearer Naples. Of the men of Scanno, who dress in dark blue cloth with brown woollen gaiters, very few are seen in the town, as they are principally on the neigh¬ bouring mountains in summer, and during winter in Apulia, with the flocks, in which the wealth of Scanno consists. Wool forms the great article of trade between Scanno and the neighbouring towns, and long files of mules laden with it are constantly passing through the narrow defile towards Solmona, one of the few outlets from this secluded valley. My new host is said to be very wealthy, and though his palace is very large now, yet he is doubling its extent.

Scanno is an exceedingly cold place, and in winter is surrounded by snow for many months; the air is very pure and healthy. Nothing appears certainly known of the origin of the town, and the earliest notice of it is about 1450.“ Pachichelli suggests, that it may have been called Sanno, from its having had a Samnite origin. It is more natural to suppose that it was from the union of several colonies from various parts dur¬ ing the turbulent times of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and to this the armorial insignia of the town—a cluster of castles, gives great probability. It contains about three thousand inhabitants. After drawing at the Lake, I re¬ turned to a fêsta of the Madonna, which was more worth seeing than any I ever witnessed in Italy, on account of the procession of all the women of the place in their Gala dresses; and the display of beauty was really extraor¬ dinary. At dinner, the day being Friday, tench, barbel, and bream, were the only fare: the silent sister said “ Prosit,\" as before; and the uncle the only fare: the silent sister said “ Prosit,\" as before; and the uncle would talk about that horrid Tunnel. In the afternoon, after I had finished my drawing, I rode on a good horse with Don ; there is splendid scenery about Scanno, and I suspect the pass to Castel di Sangro would be worth exploring. At Ave Maria I was delighted by the harmony of a Litany sung by great numbers of the townspeople in the principal church : the air was from Lucia di Lammermoor, and the effect was very pleasing. There is a great deal of musical feeling in these country towns; snatches of melody continually strike the ear, and I often longed to have more leisure to gather such scraps. the ear, and I often longed to have more leisure to gather such scraps. à The Latin “ Prosit,’ is frequently used, among the middle and lower classes in some parts of Italy, by persons rising from table; or when passing through a room where others are at meals.

But it was in vain to hope the servants in the house occupied me all day. But it was in vain to hope for a smile from these very obliging, but too sedate people, who were unlike the families I had hitherto seen. I thought, why do you build such rooms and the families I had hitherto seen. I thought, why do you build such rooms and a new palace, with nothing to fill it but this dulness? And how can you live a new palace, with nothing to fill it but this dulness? And how can you live day after day on tench and barbel, barbel and tench ? day after day on tench and barbel, barbel and tench ? It was my last evening at Scanno.

They are the principal people in this little town, and I cannot conceive a much less comfortable residence than their Palazzo; its only recommendation is, that, placed on a perpendicular height, it commands one of the most extraordinary views I ever saw, down the ghastly gorge I have been describing. Although these good people were hospitable in their way, truth obliges one to say that the uncleanliness of both house and owners was something uncom- mon; and this, united to a curiosity unique as far as my experience went among the Abruzzese, was depressing and uncomfortable. A pale daughter-in¬ law, who sighed as she told me she was a native of Ortona, “ un paese almenc polito,\" was the only interesting person of the house, except her two little girls, who though sharing the family evil of neglect were pretty and intelligent; and we had great fun in playing cats-cradle (a common Abruzzo game,) together. After they went to bed, two or three hours of severe penitenza ensued till supper,—the grumblings of the whole family against men and things in general being far from enlivening,—and I was glad to feign weariness and retire to a room, (the like of which happily one does not often see,) where I sate in a chair and dozed till morning.

No fault however could possibly be found with Don Colombo’s dinner; his plain lamb-cutlets, good fish, roast fowl, with entrées of vegetables and pickles; his super-excellent wine with snow, and his melon¬ steaks fried with cheese and pepper, which at least were a novelty.

As I sat below a huge rock, on which a little goat-herd was piping to his scattered charge, the sound of a chorus of many voices gradually roused the echoes of the mighty walls : a most simple and oft-repeated air, slowly chanted by long files of pilgrims, mostly women of Castel di Sangro, (perhaps fifty in num¬ ber); they were on their way to the shrine of S. Domenico, in Cocullo, and came in succession down the winding path, carrying large bales of different coloured cloths on their heads, and walking with long sticks. (See PLATE XXIV).

After a walk of about six miles over this well irrigated vale, often meeting long strings of Scanno mules laden with wool, I left Bugnara, (apparently an uninteresting town,) on my right, and shortly beyond, the valley opens to the full view of the plain of Solmona with all its mountain beauties.

No day passed without a half¬ hour being spent at her bedside; and one could not but be struck by the affection existing between all the members of this amiable family. At most of these evening visits, it is customary to hand round rosolio and confetti in great abundance.

The rest of my morning I passed at work below the ruins of Corfinium, (see PLATE XI.) and by noon was at the inn of Popoli, which town employed my time and pencil for the rest of the day September 19, 1843. Off from Popoli a long while before day, for I had cut out much work to be done ere sunset. A crescent moon and stars shone brightly as I left the town, where the jingling bells of impatient mules broke the silence of the streets. The sun rose as I again passed Cor¬ finium.

September 21, 1843. Yesterday was a day of rest at Solmona, which to-day I left three hours before sunrise, and with regret, for none but plea¬ sant memories are connected with my stay there. Of the many agreeable acquaintances these wanderings have been the means of my forming, Don F. Tabassi is perhaps one of the most intellectual and amiable. I had decided on revisiting the provinces of Chieti and Teramo, to sketch over some of our already explored ground, and perhaps make further excur¬ sions as occasion might offer, my stay always depending on weather, which, during October, is frequently very uncertain among these high mountains. I, my guide, and his ass,' now followed the high-road to Naples, (a con¬ tinual ascent,) and arrived at sunrise at the town of Pettorano, which con¬ tains about three thousand inhabitants, where I lingered to draw a most glo¬ rious view over the plain of Solmona, the Gran Sasso lifting his pyramid of rock over the high mountains beyond Corfinium. About nine miles from Solmona, after a long and steep ascent, we reached Rocca di Vall' Oscuro, a wretched little village,—picturesque enough; but one had no time to draw it. Two miles beyond, we arrived at the celebrated Piano di 5 Miglia, which I had heard and read so much of, that I looked forward to its passage with a curiosity not a little damped by the sight of a dull, narrow plain, with very little of the romantic in its appearance, and moreover, with a high road running from end to end. Yet, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, whoever was to pass this formidable spot, made his will previously; here in February, 1528, three hundred infantry of the Vene- tian League against Charles V. perished in the snow; and in the following year, March, 1529, more than five hundred Germans, under the Prince of Orange, met with a similar fate.\" So little, during summer, is there any ap¬ pearance of danger in this melancholy plain, that one hardly believes in these The expense of a mule or ass for a day’s journey is usually six or eight carlines; and the driver Del Re, vol. ii. p. 193. depends on your generosity for a buona mano.

A day or two might have been well devoted to visiting Alfidena and its Cyclopean remains, and had the weather been more favorable, I would certainly have done so. I was sorry also to give up all idea of visiting the fine mountains of the Pro¬ vince of Molise or Campobasso (the land of the Samnites), whose dark-blue crags lay southward, among cloud and gloom; but I felt desirous of leaving my present abode, which was chilly and comfortless after the bright cheerful vales of the Marsi and Peligni: so I hired a man and mule to convey me and my roba, to Monte Nero D’Omo, a town about twenty miles off, whither Don Saverio de’ Tommasis, whom I had met at Magliano, had invited me.

Towards noon, a long and bare ascent brought us to Pizzo-ferrato, (in the province of Chieti, or Abruzzo Citeriore,) when we were glad to take shelter during a violent storm of hail and thunder. It is a most romantic village, (con¬ taining about one thousand inhabitants,) at the foot of an isolated rock crowned by a convent; nothing can be wilder or less interesting than the treeless country immediately around this place, nor more superb than the endless view over ridges of purple hills crowned by little towns, forming, as it were, a continuous In little plain down to the shores of the Adriatic.

But, besides being rather weary of wandering about alone, I found the cold at these great elevations very unbearable, and I determined to omit much of the Chieti province, which is not so adapted for drawing, and to give more time to parts of the Marsica which I had not yet seen.

I had not intended to start till to-morrow, but the clouds on the Maiella decided me on endeavouring to reach the coast the clouds on the Maiella decided me on endeavouring to reach the coast to-day, having a deep-rooted fear of being detained by ten days of stormy weather, which might render travelling impossible here : whereas, once in safety at Chieti, roads either to Rome or Naples are always available.

My wish was to reach Abadessa, (one of the Greek colonies settled in Southern Italy,) by sun-set, a long journey of about thirty-five miles; but my guide Basilio, of Monte Nero D’ Omo, who was well acquainted with the country, warranted my arrival there. I reserved a possibility of halting at Chieti. The day was very hot, and the ascent to Frisa, and thence through mo¬ notonous cultivation, was tedious: the lessening Maiella and distant Corno, were the only hopes of the landscape. Beyond Frisa, the ups and downs were equally tiresome : one of the ravines was full of ruined Masserie, cot tages, gardens, &amp;c., an earthquake in the preceding January having shaken a tages, gardens, & an earthquake in the preceding January having shaken a great tract of the higher ground into the vale below After many clay ravines, and sluggish streams to ford, and a great ascent from one of these hollows, we reached Tollo, a very clean looking town, but containing no Locanda, or hope of refreshment, although the country round was fertile in figs and vines which hung in the most tantalizing manner over the well-kept hedges. At noon we arrived at Miglianico, where a wretched little Osteria was our halting-place; and dry figs, bread, and vino cotto all we could obtain as lunch. This seems curious in so rich a district as that through which we were passing, but it is the habit of the few persons who travel in this country to carry their own food with them Chieti seemed as difficult of access as on August Ist., and I resolved during the ascent not to enter it, but skirting its walls, descended into the valley of the Pescara, which I reached late in the afternoon, and after long waiting, (for the ferry was occupied by a succession of large market parties,) crossed the river into the Province of Abruzzo Ulteriore Primo, and took the route to the left.

The second was under the succeeding monarch, Ferdinand, when in reward for assistance rendered to that King by Scanderbeg, several cities were granted to him; and numerous Albanian families left their own shores in consequence, establishing themselves in Castelluccio de' Sauri, (in Capitanata,) Campo Marino, &amp;c., &amp;c.

Long droves of jetty sheep were filing away to their winter- quarters in Apulia, (see page 9) and a few screaming falcons wheeled and soared above them. The tranquillity of these elevated pastures is extreme, and I well enjoyed a quarter-of-an-hour's rest by the side of a clear fountain.

The Ricci, who possess a host and hostess was very simple and charming. The Ricci, who possess a great part of the plain about Mopolino, have also a casino at Montereale where they pass part of the vintage season. We visited the town, the shattered walls of which are of considerable extent; but at present this unfortunate place is reduced to a shade of its former prosperity. October 9, 1843. I determined on leaving the Neapolitan dominions by way of the Marsica, postponing a visit to Leonessa and Amatrice to some future opportunity, so by sunrise I was on my way from Mopolino to Mon¬ tereale, through which it is necessary to pass, and there the Giudice Don Andrea Rizzi, who had to sign my passport, superadded to his duty the refreshment of some very good café.

The morning was gray and cloudy; bye and bye it became black and grisly, and torrents of rain began to pour; but being determined on my object, I walked or ran through the frowning pass as far as Sigillo, where I remained till the rain ceased, and then sketched my way back again. Sigillo, the ancient Sigillum, six miles from Antrodoco, is a frightful place: why it was ever built one cannot guess; or why, being built, anybody lives there. It stands in one of the wildest parts of the pass, (the whole of which is of the grandest character,) at the foot of crag and precipice, and of which is of the grandest character,) at the foot of crag and precipice, and is wholly uncomfortable to look at. A few vineyards by the side of the Velino, goats climbing among the toppling rocks, announce your approach to habitations—a nest of high-roofed melancholy abodes, in jeopardy from the mountain above, and the torrent below. The ancient Via Salaria runs here through the very heart of the moun- tains, close to the Velino, which rises in the district of C. Ducale, about thirty miles above Rieti, receiving twelve streams in its passage from Fano and Borbona to Antrodoco.?

In some places the course of the old road is quite obliterated by loose stones which have rolled from the mountains above, in others, the great blocks which formed its substructions, are tossed about as if they had been pebbles. Here you follow a narrow mule track over frag- ments shivered by the fall of some vast mass from an overhanging rock ; there you cross a little opening, where, through a narrow valley you catch a glimpse of the lofty Terminillo, or his surrounding heights, already tipped with snow or folded in rolling clouds; from his sides of many channels in spring and autumn descend furious streams, blotting out all work of man as they spread downwards to the rapid Velino, and recording their passage by a deso¬ late broad tract of bare white stones.

Everything is rural and tranquil about Rieti; such flocks of sheep and turkeys—such heaps of yellow gourds at all farm-doors—such groups of pea¬ sants going to market, threading the “ dewy vale \"a by the rapid Turano.

Ricci had given me an introductory letter, begging him to provide me with one to Lionessa. The Fossa of Vedutri is a ravine of bare rocks, through which runs a stream, and up which you must wearily make your way till you reach Ve¬ dutri, an uninteresting, but clean little town at the top of all things. No end of going up to arrive at the town-gate, by a corkscrew stair¬ case road, the less pleasant that évery ten paces one encounters a slow donkey with two large Bigonze full of grapes; if you go inside these you are squeezed flat against the horrid wall; if you take the outside, your fears are excited in the most lively manner by the prospect of an immediate fall down the ravine.

He gave me a letter to the Vicar¬ ploughs, baskets, kittens, & He gave me a letter to the Vicar¬ General of Spoleto, in Leonessa, and regaled me with coffee and toast, after which, while my donkey was refreshing himself, we discoursed on various subjects, the topic nearest the worthy Canonico’s heart being the loss of in¬ come derived from the leeches, for which the lakes of the plain of Rieti are famous : these lakes are his property, and he had given permission to are famous : these lakes are his property, and he had given permission to a company of Marseillais leech-merchants to come thither a leech-fishing, and a company of Marseillais leech-merchants to come thither a leech-fishing, and by means of slices of meat and long poles they had left the poor Canonico leechless : this, he contended, was not a fair way of. taking them, the ortho¬ dox mode being to sit with your feet in the lake till you catch sufficient.

Much difference of opinion has arisen among antiquaries as to the ancient name of these high barriers, the loftiest part of which, Terminillo, is 6567 Paris feet above the level of the sea ; Tetricum, Severus, Fiscellum and the Gurgures mountains have been by turns considered as the Leonessa range,“ though the latter seem more clearly identified with it; to this day the glens and little plains among its fastnesses are celebrated for their pasturage.

The origin of the city of Amatrice is attributed, but on no good ground to the Samnites: whatever its age, I am not aware of its appearance in history until the thirteenth century, when it seems to have been the constant rival of Aquila.

For this Aquila was mulcted by King Robert in thirty-six thousand ducats, a fine after¬ wards commuted to twenty-four thousand. In 1318 a rebellion in Amatrice incensed the King so much that the Aquilani were ordered to destroy the city of their old enemies, which by fire and sword they almost utterly ac-¬ complished, no doubt with a very good will. In 1528 Amatrice was taken and held by Gian Giacopo Franco, for the King of France, but was retaken and again sacked by Prince Philibert, under the Emperor Charles V.,“ who bestowed the principality, in 1538, on Alessandro Vitelli, at which time it contained twelve hundred and sixteen families. In 1606 it passed by mar¬ riage to the Casa Orsini. In 1638 and 1703 Amatrice was devastated by earthquake: in the latter year the greater part of the city was entirely destroyed, and a great portion of the population perished, many hundreds being buried alive : this calamity the ruinous walls and churches, and the mournful appearance of the whole the ruinous walls and churches, and the mournful appearance of the whole place, sufficiently attest to this day.

A report of two or three frantic Dragons casually supping in the vicinity could not be half so horrible as that of passportless persons moving about the Kingdom of Naples, especially when supposed to have escaped from trouble-brewing Bologna. So the town was alarmed, the rural guard mounted round it all night, the Judge foreboded, and Signora Ameliorati, having already lost some relations in the last disturbances of one of these unquiet petty places, wept amain during great part of the night. October 6th—10th. Having changed my first intention of visiting Civita Reale, the birth-place of Vespasian, I returned by yesterday’s dull journey to Mopolino. Here, in the vain hope of passing by the Gran Sasso to Teramo, did I patiently wait through three days of rain and storm : the 10th of October saw me on my way to Aquila, having taken leave of the kind and hospitable Ricci with regret. All is bustle just now in these parts, as everybody, except the sick, the aged or infant, among the labouring classes, migrate during this month, to the Campagna of Rome. On the day of departure thé women and children ac¬ company the emigrants to some spot near the frontier, where a sort of Bac¬ chanalian fête solemnizes their adieux.

Aquila, spacious and melancholy, I reached at sun-set. October 10th—20th, 1844. These days I passed in Aquila, hoping for finer weather, now and then tantalized by a day of sunshine, though the mor¬ row was surely wet, so that after several disappointments, I finally decided to return to Rome, leaving the Teramana unexplored, my churches undrawn, and my good Marsican friends unrevisited. Meanwhile, my luckless stay in my good Marsican friends unrevisited. Meanwhile, my luckless stay in Aquila was enlivened by the kindness of the Ricevitore Generale, Marchese Spaventa, to whom Don C. Ricci had furnished me with an introduction, and "

One day, while drawing the church of Collemaggio, I talked with an intel¬ ligent Padre Guardiano of the convent attached to it. He informed me that the painter of the beautiful animal pieces round the walls, (representing the life of San Benedetto,) was a Flemish monk, Andrew Ruter, a pupil of Rubens.

It is shewn pub¬ licly once a year, and has a square hole over the left temple, said to have been made by the nail which caused his death. That evening, the 11th of October, was the only very fine one I was so fortunate as to enjoy in Aquila. As I strolled to the Cappuccini, I thought I had seldom seen a grander prospect, overlooking the plain and castle of Ocre, and the vast Maiella beyond, dimmed by floating clouds. Over all the Gran Sasso reared its pointed head in perfect clearness. On the 13th an hour of bright weather tempted me towards Vettoijo, supposed to be, though on slender grounds, the site of Pitinum.“ Wide flocks of turkeys speckled the plain as they slowly moved on to Rome, from the districts of Lanciano, Chieti, and Penna. They advance by daily journeys of eight, ten, or twelve miles. Vettoijo itself is but a mill, near a lake choked up with reeds, and in a damp hollow, replete with poplars. Above it is an elevated position, certainly like the site of an old city, with one it is an elevated position, certainly like the site of an old city, with one solitary ruin, part of a tomb or temple, yet standing. This antiquaries enlist  as a proof their conjectures, though it looks much like the avanzi of some Roman villa to inexperienced eyes. October 14th.

Forcona was the seat of a Bishopric in the early ages of Chris¬ tianity: under the Lombards, by whom it suffered greatly, but was not de¬ stroyed,\" it became the head of a Contado. It has been known as Civita di S. Massimo from its cathedral, and later it was called Bagno, from a collection of littlé villages, the united inhabitants of which may amount to one thousand of littlé villages, the united inhabitants of which may amount to one thousand or fifteen hundred.“ The city of Forcona was, however, fallen, and its popu¬ or fifteen hundred.“ The city of Forcona was, however, fallen, and its popu¬ lation removed to Aquila before the fourteenth century.

Then I strolled on through a little village, (where everybody was polluting the evening air with hemp,) towards the town of Fossa, before arriving at the evening air with hemp,) towards the town of Fossa, before arriving at which, the convent of Sant' Anna di Ocre provoked me to open my sketch- book.

A very learned, but rather dry, dissertation has been written by Signor Gio¬ venazzi, fixing, most indisputably, the position of Aveia. Once more I essayed to go from Aquila to Teramo, and had arranged with a guide to sleep at Pizzoli the first, and at Montorio the second night, but lo! when morning came, pouring torrents once more forbade the attempt: a sad disappointment after spending so much time and money. So not to a sad disappointment after spending so much time and money. So not to be again deluded, I hired a coach at once to Rieti, and proceeded thence immediately to Rome. Cramer, vol i. p. 338.
