HIS book is more particularly a description, with black and white drawings and twenty-four paintings, of the country and of the life of the peasants in the of the country and of the life of the peasants in the little-known Italian provinces of the Abruzzi in the Central Apennines, as they were immediately before the War. I have tried to give an account, as faithful as possible, of the life and landscape as a setting for the popular customs the life and landscape as a setting for the popular customs and beliefs and something of the past local history. Few and beliefs and something of the past local history. Few travellers go to the Abruzzi, for they are wild in every sense of the word. Before setting out in company with my father I was warned that it was \"not safe, and those who, as I found afterwards, did not know the district, assured me that it was “all brigands, but I hope that the contents of my book will show that, however primitive and at times emotional the peasants may be, true kindli- ness, and not seldom unusual courtesy, are shown to sympathetic strangers. Priests and peasants alike did all that they could to make us both comfortable, and went out of their way constantly to find for us those who could tell us the local traditions and practices. When we visited a village, perhaps only for a few hours, it was our practice to see first of all the priest, who would generally show and tell us everything which he could think of as likely to interest us. Foreigners are almost unknown to the peasants, especially in the mountains, and anyone the peasants, especially in the mountains, and anyone painting local scenes and people, and really anxious to learn all they could about them, aroused great interest and received a hearty welcome.

            "vi Preface I should like to take this opportunity of thanking all those who are preserving the ancient monuments and traditions in what is one of the most beautiful countries of the world, and are at the same time making easier the path of the ordinary traveller. Thave spelt and accented Italian words to show as clearly as I could the peculiarities of the local dialect, and I have made the translations of songs and stories as literal as possible. Thave often found it difficult to follow the original exactly, and yet be intelligible, and the English rendering may, therefore, seem a little crude, but I think that its literalness will give a true impression of the atmosphere and naïveté of the original. Changes following every- where the War of 1914-1918 are affecting the Abruzzi also, so that I hope that there is some value in a faithful record with pen and brush of the survivals in this region of much of picturesque mediæval Italy, and even of a more remote and glorious Roman past. Such sur¬ vivals cannot but have absorbing interest both for the historian, the simple lover of the past, and the scientific student of folklore, besides every Italian. Thave many friends in Italy to thank. Owing to the War it has been impossible to keep in touch with them, or to get more of the material which they promised. Some were killed, others died of disease, and others again lost their lives in the great earthquake of 1915. During that year 1 received letters describing the peasants as homeless and out in thousands on the mountain side. They were and out in thousands on the mountain side. They were going on pilgrimage to Cocullo, (in a later shock Cocullo itself was partially destroyed), and as they could not write themselves they got letters written to me asking how they could get to England, as a refuge. Amongst many of my friends I should especially like                                   "

N the autumn before the Great War, our train wound its way up amongst the Apennines, the slopes of which were covered with olives, almond trees, and vines. It was a strange country through which we went, and now and then we caught sight of a sallow-coloured and now and then we caught sight of a sallow-coloured peasant woman with a bright petticoat and a red kerchief over her mass of black hair, piling ripe tomatoes into her basket, and then we would see slow dreamy oxen, with immense horns, ploughing or wandering at will over the pasture, or feeding, or standing in the stream to cool themselves after the intense heat of the day. Everywhere was light and sun, the sky of a transparent blue, the mountains pale and shimmering in the light, and the pasture land dried and burnt up.

            "Through the Apennines 2 four in the afternoon, both animals and peasants still sought the shade of straw shelters, whenever they could pause a moment from their labours. When we arrived at the station of Aquila, we had ourselves to drag our at the station of Aquila, we had ourselves to drag our boxes outside, where we found a man in a blue blouse and torn velvet trousers, leaning on one leg against à wall. He greeted us by asking what we wanted in a voice with a queer intonation of its own. There was one small cart with a brown canopy, and into this he bundled us and our boxes and then returned to his occupation of leaning against the wall on one leg. Our horse had red tassels, metal horns, and badger’s hair hung to its harness to keep away the evil eye, and a large biga (rein holder) covered with tin and hung with bells glittered in the sun beating down on the white road which led up the hill from the station to the town. We sat under the brown canopy, and the driver under a blue umbrella. We passed an almond orchard, the delicate green foliage casting soft shadows on the browny yellow earth, and white walls beyond gleaming between the tree trunks. Groups of women and children went by carrying large copper conche (water-pots) on their heads. Then we came into the shade of the plane-tree avenue leading straight into Aquila itself. It had been a market day, and baskets of tomatoes, capsicums, and fruit were scattered round the narrow piazza. There were two fountains, one at each end, and women continually coming and going with conche full of water on their heads, whilst other women and children with large gold and enamel earrings chattered and bargained. Carts and enamel earrings chattered and bargained. Carts coyered with red, blue, and white designs all over the sides, and also with painted wheels, came creaking over the stones, drawn by the huge cream-coloured oxen one the stones, drawn by the huge cream-coloured oxen one                                   "

The piazza was surrounded with small trées just coming into flower, which looked like spiræa, but no one could tell me the name, and whenever I asked Twas told they were \"trees, or I met with the character- istic reply of the Abruzzi “ Chi lo sa\"'? (Who knows?) At one end of the piazza was the church with its campanile and jangling bells. From the doorways all round came the clang of the beating of copper, for everywhere there the clang of the beating of copper, for everywhere there are coppersmiths, and huge cauldrons and conche gleamed out of the darkness of the dwellings. The houses are irregularly built, at all levels, with ancient stone carvings over their doorways, and in the interiors immense open fireplaces. In the trough in the piazza into which the water flows from the ninety-nine spouts on one of the two fountains, most of the washing is done, and the clothes are carried away on the women's heads. Everything is carried upon the head, from a cake of soap, knitting needles, and wool to a large iron bedstead, or planks and stones. The women and children first roll a handkerchief or a piece of cloth into a flat pad, which they place on their head, and then put their soap, or bedstead, on top of it. They have no need to touch it, for their balance is perfect, and they never let anything fall. They go up and down and they never let anything fall. They go up and down the steep steps and roadways, chatter in the market, the steep steps and roadways, chatter in the market, and knit, quite unconscious of the burden they bear, and it is only children, just learning, who occasionally raise a hand to adjust the balance. Aquila is built on a hill, and its steep streets lead down to the plain beyond. The town has suffered much from to the plain beyond. The town has suffered much from many earthquakes. One of the first recorded was in A.D. 1315, the successive shocks of which were spread over a month. The inhabitants who camped in the piazza attributed their misfortunes to their sins, and in                                    "

For this reason, accord- ing to local story, the clock of the palazzo of Margherita d' Austria, daughter of the Emperor Charles V, struck ninety-nine times three hours after sunset, ninety-nine churches were built, ninety-nine piazzas, and, when the curious fountain Della Riviera was constructed in the main piazza, the water was distributed through ninety-nine spouts, each with a carved head and still existing. Some of the churches are now used as barns and storehouses. In front of them the white oxen are drawn up with their cart-loads of grain, and inside in the dimness men pile up the sacks against the walls. In the heat of the day one is the sacks against the walls. In the heat of the day one is thankful every now and then to get away from the glare, down some dark alley where it is possible to see without smoked glasses, or into the refreshing coolness of some church and look at the beautiful stone carvings. The chief recorded earthquakes in Aquila took place in the years 1315, 1349, 1456, 1462, 1616, 1703, and 1915. In that of 1703, 2000 people perished, and the greater part of the church of Collemagio was destroved,- the façade alone remaing. The carnival now takes the façade alone remaining. The carnival now takes place after the candelora (i.e. Candlemas, and February), for fear of earthquakes, because earthquakes are supposed to occur generally during January. There is a saying that \"when the cold is at its greatest, the earthquake is at its strongest. Besides earthquakes, Aquila has suffered from many wars. It was during a fight between Aquila and Rieti that the Rietini succeeded in carrying away from Aquila bell and a marble lion. This bell was placed on a tower and called the aquilanella (small eagle) as à joke against the people of Aquila. Later the people of Aquila recaptured the bell and put it again on their own palace tower, calling it the rietinella (small Rieti),                                   "

            "First Days in the Abruzzi 7 got the answer ? Chi lo sa, li portiamo tutti \" (Who knows, we all wear them), or we were told that they also were we all wear them), or we were told that they also were against the evil eye (malocchio). Children wear badgers hair and a little bunch of tin or silver charms all hanging from a circle with the number thirteen in it. The most common charms are a cornucopia, a horn, a frog, a Pope's head with mitre and crozier, a closed hand with the fore- finger extended, a horseshoe, a boot, a duck, cross-keys, a hunchback (gobbetto), a frog and horns combined, a heart, a broom, a bottle, the two horns, and a basket. Later, when we gained the confidence of the people, we were told other means of keeping off the evil eye. In the narrow streets we saw men and boys making the bigas and covering them with shining tin, red woollen tassels, horns, bells, crescents, little hunchbacks, or numerous horses and metal flags to turn in the wind and glisten in the sunlight, to keep away the evil eye from the horses ; or they would beat an indented design of the Virgin and Child, flowers, and horses' heads for the sides of the bigas, and fix brass heart ornaments to the harness. Bunches of badgers' hair or horns are fixed in the place of blinkers, and horns also fastened to the buckle which ornaments the harness under the chest. The oxen are shod,—I think in two pieces,—so that the cloven hoof is bridged by a piece of iron, and such pieces and the shoes of mules and donkeys are hung up over the doors or in the houses against the evil eye. We looked into one of the many jewellers' shop windows, and, seeing foreigners, the jeweller came out to talk to us. He invited us in to see the charms and amulets which he sold. We entered, and found ourselves plunged at once into the mediæval atmosphere of the Abruzzi, with its numerous traces of ancient customs and beliefs. We                                   "

            "Through the Apennines 8 asked if we might see his charms, and he showed us the medals of S. Benedetto which he sold for a protection against hail, lightning, and thieves. He explained that to effect this the medal is put on the top of buildings, to effect this the medal is put on the top of buildings, under the eaves, on the campanile (belfry), or on the boundaries of fields. The medal of S. Antonio is believed to be a protection to cattle and horses, and should it be to be a protection to cattle and horses, and should it be lost, the peasants fear the death of their animals. Red coral is one of the commonest charms, and nearly everyone wears it in some form or other. Coral horns are especially good against the evil eye, but he told us they must not be worked with iron, in which case they lose their virtue, (as they do if broken.) He also sold small iron keys which are hung round a baby's neck to prevent epilepsy, and brass or silver keys to prevent convulsions. Silver keys, on account of their colour, I was told are symbolic both of the Holy Ghost and of the Trinity. Pieces of stag's of the Holy Ghost and of the Trinity. Pieces of stag's horns mounted in silver are also used, and all charms are generally blessed by the priest. He drew our attention to the many pictures of the Madonna and Child which have a coral necklace on the Babe, and then I remembered also to have seen thirteen forks used as a decorative design down the sides of a picture of the Madonna. We bought some of the charms, and asked for more information. We learnt that, if it is thought that an animal has been affected by the evil eye, a piece of cloth taken secretly from the suspected person a piece of cloth taken secretly from the suspected person and put on the animal will cure it, \"unless the disease be the will of God!\" The first bearskin leggings that a be the will of God!\" The first bearskin leggings that a child wears will cure an animal of tummy-ache. (Bears are found in the mountains, and there are curious beliefs are found in the mountains, and there are curious beliefs about them.)

            "First Days in the Abruzzi which I could not identify, is said to have a queer power of attraction for both men and beasts; once a goat was found in front of this herb, but on examination only the skin remained, all else having been absorbed. Cat bites are supposed to be poisonous, and the hair from the cat which has bitten one, mixed with powdered garlic, will effect a cure; the same cure applies to serpent bites. (A really good cat, by the way, must have been stolen, and not bought.) Black hens have mysterious powers, and their fat is good for irritation; no one kills a black hen, for fear of seven years' misfortune, and its beak will restore a suffocated child when put in its ear. The hen which crows like a cock should be at once killed, as otherwise the head of the house will die. If a hen crows towards the mountains, it is a good sign, but if towards the sea it is bad. It is believed that oblong eggs will produce cocks, and round ones hens, and to obtain a good clutch a nail is put in the middle of the eggs. If the nest is placed in a man's hat, then cocks are hatched. When we left our jeweller the streets were crowded with people who had taken refuge there in search of comparative coolness. The sunset sky was a brilliant crimson, and the mountains a deep purple against it. The sunset seemed to echo the passionate character of the people. Shouts and music and laughter were everywhere, and continued long into the night; above all was a cloud- less summer sky and the brilliant stars.

UR friends in Aquila told us that about thirty miles away in the mountains there were interesting and primitive little villages, of the kind which we wished to explore. We were driven therefore down the valley for several miles, along the almond orchards and the fields of maize and ploughed earth. At first there were peasants houses and barns, with stone carvings over the doors and windows, and we saw peasants and oxen going slowly along the road. Then we left behind all trace of human life. Everywhere were barren tracts of stone with burnt grass, and barren range behind barren range stretched away as far as we could see. There were immense ravines of chalk with the intense glare of the sun upon them, of chalk with the intense glare of the sun upon them, only broken by the blue-grey shadows that the different ridges cast upon each other.

Far beneath in the distance we could see a village, and hear the guns firing and the church bells ringing as a long procession of black and white specks, looking as small as ants, wound its way along a white road to the church. This village, our driver told us, was near where the famous brigand, Caruso, had lived, and his memory still terrorised the inhabitants. The driver said that the village which was our destination was full of brigands, but that he was not afraid of them, even if he travelled by night, as he had no money, but, he added, he was always careful he had no money, but, he added, he was always careful of the wolves and preferred to travel with a revolver. Then he pointed to an almond tree near by, and said that the shepherd who stayed out nearby with his sheep generally slept in that tree to be safe from the wolves. His dog had a large iron collar studded with nails, with points outwards, and he protected the sheep, but very often the wolves managed to carry off a prey. The driver told us that certain people are bound by their evil star to become lupi minari (lupomanaro, werwolf), and he said that they know this, and before their destined and he said that they know this, and before their destined hours of transformation they take precautions not to injure their own cattle, by carefully shutting the stable door with the watch-dog inside, and putting the key in a safe place. The unfortunate werwolf then spills some water in the dust on the ground and rolls himself in it, and becomes a lupo minaro, howling so furiously that he even makes his own cattle’s hair stand on end. This brings all the neighbouring wolves out in search of prey. Finally he retires to the threshold of his stable, and again rolls in the dust and resumes his human form.

At midnight, one said to his companion in a mysterious way,—Dear friend, we are all born under the influence of our own star, often good, often bad; my evil destiny is to be a lupo minaro and the hour is at hand, but do not fear! Go and remain on the top of the straw rick until I return to my human form, and, when all is safe, I will call you down. His companion, very frightened, climbed up upon the straw, saw his friend pour water on the dust, and then roll himself thrice in it. He then became a lupo minaro. Lifting his head in it. He then became a lupo minaro. Lifting his head and revealing two bloodshot eyes and gaping jaws, he and revealing two bloodshot eyes and gaping jaws, he uttered a terrible howl. His yell echoed all around, and from every direction wolves appeared and formed a circle round the rick, sniffing the air and looking up at the terrified man. At last the wolves ran away, but one the terrified man. At last the wolves ran away, but one wolf returned, carrying half a sheep, and, peering to make sure that the man on the stack did not see him, he rolled three times in the wet dust, and resumed his human form. Then he called to his companion,— Come down, all is over. His companion descended, and the two friends prepared and cooked the half sheep, but the lupo minaro ate very little, for he was more than satisfied with the raw meat he had already eaten. Our driver added that once a certain person offended another and struck him. The following night a pack of werwolves (lupi minari) killed about two hundred of his sheep without the sheep dog barking or the shepherd sheep without the sheep dog barking or the shepherd hearing anything of it. The sheep were only bled to death, because the wolves preferred to suck the warm blood. This could be done because the dogs and the shepherds were ligati (bound, i.e. paralysed) by the lupi minari, their senses being made dormant (stunned), and their eyelids weighted with sleep.

We could imagine the feelings of the lonely shepherd climbing into the almond tree on a bright moonlight night, when every shadow would take a queer form and even the mica in the rocks would catch the moonlight and glitter like fierce wolves' eyes watching their prey. This idea was still more creepy when we learnt that on Christmas Eve the lupo minaro (male) and lupa mannora (female) are said to wander round ululando (howling), disturbing the Christmas peace, and that, to prevent this, at the crossing of the ways (cape croce) small white crosses from the procession Ascension Day are fixed. The lupo minaro may be detected by his having hair and nails like a wolf, and at night he howls like a wolf. If he like a wolf, and at night he howls like a wolf. If he meets anvone he eats him up, but, if the one he meets has the courage to prick him and make his blood spurt out, the lupo minaro recovers from his disorder and resumes his human shape.

We went on again, our driver remarking that we should not sée anyone else until we came to the house of the cantoniere (roadmender), which was about half way to our destina- tion, and that there we could get water. We rode on through the barren hills, passing here and there large golden bunches of flowering broom with blossoms larger than any 1 have ever seen, and looking like bright vellow jewels against the blue and purple mountains and barren stones. There were also thistles, blue succory, and a spiky yellow flower not known to me, and a little dried-up grass, the only sign of life being lizards, and an occasional snake, or a falcon poising over our heads. There was no water anywhere, only stone and bits of mica glittering in the sun, and not a single peasant did we see on all that long road until we came to the cantoniere's house. There, two swarthy girls ran to fill bottles of icy water from the spring and handed them to us to sip, while the horses were put into the common stable where no fee is charged, We went on and came to a few small fields of corn, and then to a green hollow where there was grass, bracken, bushes, and a little trickle of water trying to find its way over the grass. Our driver turned to us and said.— It is here that the twelve cows,the only cows in the whole country,—are kept, and they are Swiss and were bought and kept here for their milk.

There were more caves visible in the rocks, and the driver told us again that they had been the dwelling places of brigands, and that, although they were no longer there,who knows?—we might have encounters with them in the village where we were going. After several hours of silence he pointed we were going. After several hours of silence he pointed his whip to the left and said,— There is Campotosto. Are you going to stop here or go on to Mascione? You say the people are better, and wear better costumes at Mascione?\" \"Yes,\" he answered, and there is food there, bread and oil, and the petticoats of the women are brighter colours. \"Then we will go there, we said. We came to some long-shaped fields of corn, rye, and grass, and the wind as it swept over the surface made them rise and fall in waves like the sea. Women and children in gaily striped petticoats were working in the corn, and others were followed by mules and goats as they went along the pathways. Beyond was a strip of brilliant green and burnt-sienna coloured swampy land, some low hills, and then Campotosto piled up on a hill, behind which were higher hills. We came to a narrow road, along which our driver went as far as he could, and then he stopped and said,—You must walk the rest. The road goes no farther.\" The village of Mascione was away over more swampy ground, and like Campotosto it had been piled up on the top of a hill. We asked how far it was. \"Who knows?\" he replied, \"an hour or more. 1 must be back before nightfall, and with that he put the baggage on to the road and drove away.

Part of the way was dry, and part was thick mud into which we went above our ankles, and all the peasants, horses, and mules we passed stared at us. The animals had magnifi¬ cent manes and tails, which are never ruined by docking, and all animals, except the foals, had their fore feet roped together \"al pasquatore \" (for pasturing). This we after¬ wards learnt was to prevent them from going far away into the mountains, and it is customary everywhère in this region. With their hind feet they walked, but with their fore feet they jumped, so that they looked as if they were hopping over the grass like kangaroos. The foals have all their legs free, but they do not stray, as they never leave the older animals. In towns and mountains alike, one sees foals trotting after their mothers. At Campotosto the animals are freed after work and when not wanted. Mules and donkeys are far more intelligent than horses in the mountains, especially donkeys, and they can go in the mountains, especially donkeys, and they can go all day without food and only eat half as much as a horse. Then we came to the stony bed of the stream. Thère was only a little water, and we went up along it, amongst the stones. Above us we could see a track a few inches wide, and it looked as if it led to the village.

Throughout the Abruzzi the peasants always said that words of enchantment must only be taught on Christmas Eve. We came to the end of the sandy path, and the woman now seemed anxious to get away; possibly she did not like to be seen talking so freely to strangers, especially when I had only just arrived and had talked about local beliefs. I therefore said \"Good-night' and escaped to our rooms. The last rays of an orange sun streamed into the room while we washed up the two thick bowl-shaped plates and the glasses Maria had lent us. We went to the window to watch the moon rise, and queer strange sounds came to us from the village. We heard the chatter and songs of the women as they passed beneath the window with the large copper conche of water on their heads, whilst the pigs, who, during the day, lay in the sand basking in the sun beside every peasant's house, whined and grunted for their evening meal. Some of them followed their owners their evening meal. Some of them followed their owners about, others pushed at the doors of the houses and grunted until either they were opened or the owner came out and sat on the doorstep and fed them from wooden pails. The pigs grunted with contentment as they thrust their snouts into the food, children laughed and petted the pigs as if they were dogs, and the women sat and the pigs as if they were dogs, and the women sat and chattered or sang over these wooden pails.

When we returned, Maria asked us to come and see her bouse. We went up five or six steps into a low square wooden room with a large hearth at one end on which were the remains of a wood fire. There was a rough bench and table, and a few thick bowl-shaped plates and copper utensils on shelves to the left of the fireplace. The window was small, and there was a hole in the ceiling. to the side of which was fixed a rickety ladder leading to the room above. A low narrow doorway opened into another little room, and there were spread about a loom which was not just then in use, a kind of trestle table for making bread, and a wooden box in which bread and different odds and ends were kept. Some copper utensils and the numerous family clothes hung over the loom and along a line stretched from wall to wall. The woman ladled water from the conca to the cheese-making pot, and I decided to paint her with her background of various clothes.

We lived on our own provisions as long as possible, but one day when I heard a hen cackling I knew there must be an egg, and finding a hen cackling I knew there must be an egg, and finding that no one in particular seemed to want it I insisted on having not only that egg but several others also. Another time we persuaded them to let us have a chicken. It was an unheard of thing, but the chicken, which was about the size of a blackbird, duly arrived, and, as I did not wish to waste my time cooking, Maria said she would do it for me. I think she must just have put it in the cinders, for when she brought it to us, wrapped up in a torn bit of blue paper with a burnt onion, it was black and hard like charcoal, but we were desperately hungry and ate it ravenously, and afterwards the bones with an onion, sour bread, and some scanty bits of thyme from the moun¬ tains made quite a good soup !

After my day’s painting we used to go for a tramp through the village and into the country. Over one house there was the large stone carving of which there is à drawing on page 41. In many places in Italy it is a common practice to put a charduse (a large thistle which grows close to the ground and generally has only one blossom) over the door to keep away witches. Here, however, the whole thing was carved in stone with the addition of a face in the disc. In Aquila I had noticed many houses which had the carving of the disc and rays over the doorways; some also had the eyes, nose, and mouth, others were simply a circle, and others again had the Christian I.H.S. in the middle, but this was the only the Christian I.H.S. in the middle, but this was the only one with the suggestion of the thistle leaves as well. No one could or would tell me what it meant, whether it was the symbol of the sun, or why it was there, and they was the symbol of the sun, or why it was there, and they all smiled when I asked. None of the other houses had anything of the kind. I suspected that it was to keep witches from entering the house, for in North Italy the charduse is believed to do so and is put over the door, The peasants told me that Castel del Sangro (Chap. xvi) witches, who are both male and female, come into the houses through the keyholes to suck the babies' blood, the houses through the keyholes to suck the babies' blood, after greasing themselves all over. When once within the house the witch eats a piece of bread, and this enables the witch to materialise, but valerian is put in the keyholes, a knife fixed in the floor, or a broom, saws, and scythes put D                                    "

The witch can be caught, recognised, beaten, and turned out, and is only set free after imploring pardon. Sometimes witches take the form of cats and dogs, and are placed in a sack and beaten for punishment, after which they have to pass through a ring of the fireplace chain. Then they can only become free by begging for pity in the name of S. Ciovanni, and the woman who undoes thé spell is reverenced. On Christmas Eve pigs’ blood can be used to discover witches. These queer beings terrify the peasants. Even in church they do not feel safe from them. To prevent their escape, three pins are put in the Holy Water (Atri; Ortona), or a knife is planted in the ground (Rocaraso). The witch can then only leave the church by saluting and giving both hands to the man whom he has harmed, and giving both hands to the man whom he has harmed, calling him compare (partner) and promising to do him no more harm for seven generations. From all I was told it seemed to be clear that witches are not born, but become so, and anyone with a bad will goes to sit on the Sacred Stone behind the altar on Christ- mas Eve, and thence goes out of the church by a separate door. He gathers la fece (fern), a plant in the form of à hand called \"the herb of accord or discord.\" The fingers of this herb are joined or disconnected when the witch wishes to affect the soul of a victim.

            "Round Mascione 33 atmosphère was so clear that we saw the flocks of sheep with their shepherds quite distinctly. The shepherds all have straw shelters like the one on Plate I, in which they sleep to protect themselves from the wolves. About 3000 sheep were in the pasture of Pian d'Emparatore; at night the rams, ewes, and lambs are separated, each at night the rams, ewes, and lambs are separated, each with their own net round them. When they stand, they nearly always remain more or less circular groups, with their heads together almost touching the ground. When they lie down, they are generally in one large group. Some of the shepherds are their own masters, but others are sent from the Roman Campagna by their owners during the summer, and only go down to the plains in the winter months. Their masters give the shepherds the winter months. Their masters give the shepherds rye or rice, oil, and a share of the sheep's cheese and milk produced. Each shepherd has a certain number of sheep and dogs, with large iron collars studded with spikes, to protect them from wolves. Before the sheep are shorn they are thrown into a small square pond and are shorn they are thrown into a small square pond and shaken, to wash them. They have big bells. When fine the shepherds wear their leather coats with a sheep- skin lining inside, but when wet the wool is put outwards. Inside the shelters are one or two scraps of blanket, a bag of rice, and oil. The two latter, with cheese made from sheep's milk, and the milk itself, are the usual food of the shepherds. Outside the shelters there is generally à copper cauldron like a preserving pan, and it is in this that the cheese is made, and there are also wooden pails with one side higher for milking. Generally there is also a large blue umbrella and a cover to throw over the shelter should it rain very heavily. This cover is made in an ingenious way, of old rags, otherwise useless, twisted                                   "

Near the shelters there is usually also a coarse string net which is supported by sticks thrust into the ground, and this serves as a fold for the sheep at night, whilst the dogs remain outside to guard the sheep at night, whilst the dogs remain outside to guard them. We wandered over the ridges of barren earth which reflected every change of colour in the sky. One moment they were a harmony of greys, blues, and purples, and then they changed to pinks, dull oranges, and browns with delicate grey shadows, and they were always most loyely. Some of the ridges were steep, others gentle slopes, and every now and then peasants came riding over them. For an instant they were beneath one, then came to where one was standing, saluting as they passed, and the next moment they would be outlined against the sky on the edge of the next ridge. Both men and women rode the edge of the next ridge. Both men and women rode astride either donkeys or mules or horses with beautiful tails. Often they were armed, but they generally carried only a long stick and agricultural tools. Children rode with them, babies wrapped in their mothers' shawls, and little boys and girls seated behind, clinging to their mothers and fathers. All the women wore white head- dresses, and many of them had a green piece of cloth also covering them. They looked just as if they were Madon- nas flying into Egypt.

We were approaching another barren ridge, and it appeared to have immense boulders along its crest, but when we drew nearer we saw they were the ruins of a castle. There was a change in the air, and clouds came sweeping up over and down the peaks, and the clear blue mountains, stones, and ruined castle changed to every shade of pink, purple, and grey. Stretching away there was nothing save the bareness and stony ridges with ruined castles and rocks jutting out. It looked just as if some savage spirits had piled up beautiful palaces and then joing in a rage with storm and earthquake suddenly destroyed them, leaving the remains in utter solitude. The road twisted, going along the side of a steep slope hundreds of feet beneath, and covered with loose stones, and then it led between the ridges, some of which showed large holes in their gleaming white sides, evidently the entrances to in their gleaming white sides, evidently the entrances to caves. These caves are deep grottos cut in the mountain where the peasants keep potatoes all the year round. Each cave has a wooden door guarding the entrance. Were they hiding places from the fury of past destruction, we wondered? A bend in the road brought us to some burnt-up grass in a kind of dingle where cattle were grazing, the next moment we were in amongst the stones again, and then suddenly beheld in front of us the little castle town of S. Stefano piled up on its hill, the sides of which went almost sheer down into the valley. Behind were the stony mountains and the ruined castle and over- hanging houses bathed in a glowing light with delicate purple and blue shadows. It all looked like a fairy town. There was a narrow pathway leading up to the village itself,                                  "

When we went out of the courtyard we saw that there was the usual dead falcon and ox horns hanging over the doorway, and the archiprete said it was customary to have them everywhere. to have them everywhere. We asked him to tell us any customs, stories, or super¬ stitions. He said he knew some beliefs about storms and whirlwinds, but the only legends which came into his head were those of the waterspouts, which he would try to remember. We had come through some of the wildest deserted country, and when he said he could only think of superstitions connected with storms we realised how much nature had worked on our own imaginations and felt that it would be possible to believe almost anything. He told us that storms are due to bad spirits which are called lu cifferotte, and that it is the Devil who makes destructive winds when he has lost somebody's soul,                                   "

When the Devil first starts riding on the clouds, the ringing of bells is effective and will stop him from doing more harm. Hail is made when two clouds join, one being over the top (male) of the other cloud (female). The male cloud makes the rain wind cloud (female). The male cloud makes the rain wind pass between them, and the female cloud freezes the rain, producing hail. Once a priest who was passing the Palena mountain saw a male and female spirit making hail, and to stop them he put the largest hailstone he could find on to stop them he put the largest hailstone he could find on the palm of a child under seven years old (the most the palm of a child under seven years old (the most innocent of the family), because he believed the tempest would only last the time the hailstone took to melt, but if he had collected the hail the tempest would have become worse. He said that thunderstorms may be prevented by keeping the sacred ashes of charcoal from the burning of the log (ceppo) on Christmas Eve, and anything left over from the Christmas dinner is burnt on the ceppo for Gesu Bambino (the child Christ). These same ashes are also rekindled for maintaining the temperature in silkworm rearing. The archiprete then told us that the monks sell to sailors specially printed prayers to protect them from waterspouts, and that, when the sailors see a waterspout coming, they say certain words and turn towards it, cutting the air with a knife with a black handle and making the sign of the a knife with a black handle and making the sign of the cross with the knife.

They did not kill it, but bruised it. The old man, taking pity, stopped the boys, and with his stick threw the serpent into the middle of a hedge. In its fall one of its eyes was hurt and bled. Some years after, the same old man went to Ancona for the feast of S. Ciriaco. At the palace window he saw a beautiful girl, who was blind in one eye. Directly she saw him she came into the street, welcomed him affectionately, asked him in, and treated him most him affectionately, asked him in, and treated him most sumptuously. To the old man all this seemed as a dream which he could not explain, but the girl told him she had been the serpent which he had saved from stoning, and, although she had lost one eye, he had saved her life and thereby also enabled her to resume human form and return home. Another story told how once on S. Pietro’s day a boat put out fishing and met a waterspout. One fisherman tried to cut it with his knife, but was not quick enough, and the boat capsized ; only a few of the fishermen were saved. Among these was the man who had tried to dispel the waterspout. On arriving at home he found his wife with one of her fingers severed and bleeding. He was convinced that she was the waterspout and that now she was libera, liberated from that form; and he so ill-treated her that she died. The road we followed went in amongst the stony ridges. Up above we saw the ruins of another castellated village, and down beneath on the ridges rising out of the valley were other ruined castle-hamlets.

We turned to gaze at La Roca, which looked most wonderful with the crimson setting sun behind its ruins. The white road reflected the illuminated clouds, which every moment were becoming more brilliant; the ridges towards the evening sky were curious harmonies of the greys of the stones and the warm browny purply greens of the baked earth and dried-up tussocks of grass. Standing out clear and sharp against the sky was a shepherd with his sheep, and in another the sky was a shepherd with his sheep, and in another moment the whole flock lifted up their heads and looked at us, and the dog with his spiked collar barked and rushed down furiously. Seeing, however, that we passed by, he rushed back to the shepherd, and the sheep dropped their heads and went on grazing on anything they could find amongst the stones. The road wound in and out, but the right side became less precipitous, and we saw attempts to cultivate corn on the banks sloping down into the valley. The valley had ploughed fields and square patches of burnt grass. In front of us lay two immense hillocks, very steep, with the road going between them.

A boy was riding her barebacked, and he was without even the rope noose which is so often used. Four or five riderless foals tried to keep up with the mare's wild career, but they could not go so quickly. Our driver said that these horses were almost wild, but it was not until we had ridden into the mountains to see where they were bred that we learnt how untamed they are. Then we saw Castel del Monte towering up before us. It was lighted by the last rays of the setting sun, while all else was fast fading into the shades of twilight, and with the dimmed flickering lights from the tower and windows the dimmed flickering lights from the tower and windows it looked even more enchanting and mysterious than the other villages we had left behind.

We climbed the last bit of the hill and came to the piazza, where oxen, mules, horses, foals, and goats were all of them struggling for their evening draught, some of them, apparently ownerless, tearing down the narrow paths from the mountains. Savage-looking women with their jewels and coloured handkerchiefs carried conche and terra-cotta pottery on their heads to the fountains in the middle of the piazza, and we were sur- rounded by the enquiring faces of men, women, and boys.

He and the poet were my two special friends in the village. After- wards, when I was working in other villages and came home at dusk, he and the poet generally met me and walked as far as the alley leading to the house. My friends told me of the song of the months, and they took much trouble in getting it written out for me. The dialect is difficult, but with the help of the priest I believe that I finally got it correct: SONG OF THE MONTHS. INTRODUCTION. INTRODUZIONE.

Another group of women came in single file down the track with large faggots of wood on their heads, and seemed amazed to see us. Our little man walked as fast as the animals, and he never uttered a word the whole way. Range bevond range of mountains became visible, and there were more stones than before and, if possible, greater barrenness. An eagle,—the only sign of life,—soared away into the blue, and then re-appeared and was lost again behind the mass of stony mountains to our left. At last we reached the top of the pass. There was short grass, and then down the top of the pass. There was short grass, and then down beneath us from right to left stretched the plain, behind which rose an immense wall of jagged rocky mountains crowned by the Gran Sasso. To the right, at the foot of these mountains, were some thick forests, and shepherds who passed with their sheep said it was in these forests that the wolves lived. We could not see any sheep in the plain; they all seemed to have been taken to pasture on the hills, and, as we had a long way to return and a bad storm was blowing up, we remounted and set out homewards. Riding astride without a saddle was all very well until we reached the top of the pass, but when we began to go jogging the top of the pass, but when we began to go jogging down over the stones one slid forward, and quite the most comfortable way was sitting tailor-fashion, or with the left leg down, the right knee making a pommel which prevented one from slipping, or, as an alternative, riding fairly far back with one foot on each side of the animal's neck, in the way many of the peasants ride. The clouds drifted down, and for a short time it was chilly, but they cleared, and then it was hot as ever. On our return to Castel del Monte the archiprete (priest) asked us where                                   "

Some of the houses had beautiful pillars to their windows, with capitals and moulding of varied design, and others had carving round the doors, beautiful open fireplaces, and carved and painted ceilings. These little houses were evidently the remains of the large castle belonging to the Medici, now divided up into small houses and rooms in which the peasants lived. I did several pencil sketches of a pointed arch with its carved arms overhanging steps leading up to doors almost under the eaves of the houses, and I also began a colour sketch of the gallery\" which was one of the main thoroughfares of the place. It was an arched passage underneath the houses, and had grim an arched passage underneath the houses, and had grim entrances through the stable doors into the buildings, There were openings out of which the inhabitants could créep to see what their enemies were up to, and then rush back under cover, and it was here that the whole village congregated, chatting, spinning, occasionally feed- ing a goat or chicken, and doing all kinds of odds and ends. ing a goat or chicken, and doing all kinds of odds and ends.

I could not work long, for the dim light changed quickly, and besides, hearing that we wanted pots, the peasants kept coming with everything they possessed. The archiprete walked up and down, trying to keep them away and telling them to bring the things to his house, and when we returned we found the little room crowded with carpets, terra-cotta, brass, coins, a Roman fibula, plates, woodwork, jewellery, and a queer a Roman fibula, plates, woodwork, jewellery, and a queer peacock whistle.

We left strict injunctions that we should be quite happy with bread and eggs, water, and fruit if there were any, and that he must not give himself any extra trouble. When the sketch was finished, we went as we had promised. After the eggs I said I had enough, but the archiprete was horrified, and told us that the eggs were only a preliminary. We had the eggs without any plates or tablecloth, but at this stage he told the woman to get a clean tablecloth, glasses, knives, and plates, and the soup.

After the meat, came a dish of chicken cooked with all kinds of herbs, followed by another dish of chicken differently cooked. In between each course the woman wiped my knife and fork and gave me a fresh plate.

While we waited for our driver we talked to an old man who looked like a crumpled-up withered leaf, and seated on a stone wall he sang us the song of S. Antonio, and described how on the night of January 16th the peasants dressed as pilgrims make a chorus and go round ringing bells and singing “ Domani è S. Antonio\" (to-morrow is S. Antonio's Day) accompanied by music. Next day on the festa of S. Antonio Abate (17th January), decorated sledges drawn by oxen and laden with big logs of wood are taken round by the peasants, and the wood distributed amongst the convents. After a good meal they all return in a procession, and then a peasant dresses up as S.

At last we arrived at the top of the ridge, and followed the narrow path between small fields of rippling grain with stones piled up round their edges, and we caught the breeze as it came sweeping over the corn, making it rise and fall like the waves of the sea. My horse sniffed the air and dipped down into a cornfield to get some mouthfuls of grain, and this he tried to do several times, but I made him content himself with snatching at a few stray overhanging ears by the path. He knew quite well that our tall athletic- looking guide with his coffee-coloured complexion and his large sombrero hat drawn down over his black eyes was looking at him to see that he behaved. We still went up, finding it was not quite so steep, but there were no more cornfields, and again we went through loose stones. Our animals were very sure-footed ; the mules never stumbled and it was only now and then that the horse half-stumbled and then, to keep his balance, just slid with the falling stones. Our guide told us that these horses, born and bred in the mountains, are almost as sure-footed as the mules, the one disadvantage being that they never \"smell a precipice when they are nearing it, like a mule who, a precipice when they are nearing it, like a mule who, however quickly he may be going, even if he is running away, will draw up at the edge of the precipice, whereas a horse plunges down it straightaway without realising it is there. Mules are seldom killed or hurt, because they never struggle, but simply relax and let themselves go¬ whereas a horse struggles and becomes rigid and either gets killed or his limbs broken.

But the shepherds had breakfasted earlier than usual and they were far away, some going over the plain and others climbing the hillsides with their sheep, which varied in number from 200 to 300.

Francesco's convent lived in peace and prosperity until a certain old woman came to it. At first they refused her admission, but she so insisted and appealed to their feelings that last they accepted her as a cook. Little by little she persuaded them to give up one fast after another until all were given up. It was the same with the Confession and all other religious practises, and the convent, which used to be very rich, possessing one thousand cows, became poor and was reduced to only one hundred cows.

An old man who was present listened devoutly, and to follow that advice gave away his only cow to the first poor man he met. Every day he returned to the church and prayed for his one hundred cows in return for the one given away. One morning he found -Go to the convent of S. Francesco, show a note saying, a note saying, this note, and your wish will be fulfilled. He went, and presented the note to the gatekeeper, who on reading it found the following,— Let all and everything be blessed in the convent. Deliver the last one hundred cows of the convent to this man, and the former riches of the convent will return.\" Next day a procession was ordered; the old cook was invited to join, but refused, with the excuse that she had too much to do in the kitchen. The friars went in procession and blessed all the stables, cellars, cells, and passages, and at last reached the kitchen. The old cook, hearing their psalmody, hid in the cupboard, but, the instant they opened it to bless the inside, the woman was transformed into flame, which pierced the vault of the ceiling and disappeared. The hole can still be seen. Morica said this story is told to children at Castel del Monte to prove to them the existence of the Devil. As he repeated it he made me feel that he himself believed he repeated it he made me feel that he himself believed every word of it, although possibly he did not wish to admit this fact to me. My impression of this deepened when he told the following stories.

It is most difficult to get information about this book. Once a peasant promised to show it to me secretly, but I never saw it. So far as I can gather, it is a mediaeval book of magic, which is still passed in secret through the mountains both in north and south Italy. The old man of Calascio, continued Morica, asked the three shepherds,—How much will you give me if, from this spot, I make you return in a few minutes to Castel del Monte to see your young wives?\" The two shepherds agreed to pay eight florins each, but, said Morica, my grandfather paid nothing. Outside the sheepfold three horses appeared, which carried them in a few seconds to near Castel del Monte, but they were unable to go beyond the Chapel. The riders therefore alighted, tied the horses to the trees, and walked the rest of the way. They reached their homes, entered un- observed, and in the night they saw their wives without being able to touch them. After this they rode back. The only words they could say to the animals were \"Il diavolo scappi (rompi) collo!\" (May the devil break your neck !) In Apulia my grandfather refused to pay any- thing, but struck the old man and stole his book. Later he returned with it to Castel del Monte and laid fattura (a charm) upon his old sweetheart, who had refused him. Afterwards he became ill and died.

Some shepherds asked him to do this, but Scaramella said that if he did the wolves would come and eat their sheep. On their insisting, he called the wolves, which came, and killed the sheep during the night while the shepherds were asleep. The shepherds, infuriated, tried to kill Scaramella with their heavy sticks, and he was obliged to run for hislife. Another time, when burning his charcoal, he again called the wolves, and told his friends how many would come. He hid in the trunk of a tree where he was wont to sleep, and the wolves came. After counting them, he lit a fire to send them away, but one remained, his tail caught in the trunk of the tree. From inside the tree Scaramella pulled its tail, shouting at each pull. To extricate itself, the wolf pulled all the more. After a fierce struggle the wolf gave a sharp pull and ran away, leaving its tail behind. The wolf became more and more mischievous, and the shepherds determined to kill it, but it left the mountains, went down into the plains of Teramo, and did so much damage that everyone was in despair. In the summer, Scaramella went to the Teramese to reap, and he promised to expel the wolf. Everyone laughed, but one night he slept where the wolf had been. As usual it came, jumped into the middle of the sheepfold, and Scaramella called out,— Ci vogliamo riessere'' (we want to pull). The wolf became so frightened that it fled, and next morning was found dead. The Teramesi carried Scaramella in triumph to Castel del Monte, giving him seven asses laden with corn, chickens, and other presents.

Giovanna Petroni had lost several children, and, as we were worried about her last baby, who was ailing and we were worried about her last baby, who was ailing and becoming very thin, we wondered what we should do, said Morica. Finally we decided that a certain witch was sucking it, and we asked Alessandro, a bricklayer, who was suspected of being a stregone (wizard), if he would go to see her. He went, telling her he knew how to cure her child. Giovanna had no money, but agreed to give him twenty yards of hemp cloth (forotella). The bargain was concluded, the cloth handed over, and Alessandro made a breve* for the baby, put it round its neck and assured the mother that the baby would recover, but it would be necessary also to keep the witch out of the way. To do so, at midnight she must undo the fascie (swathings) of the baby, because the witch was hidden in it, stretch them out on the floor, and cut them into pieces with a hatchet. This was done. During the night many hard strokes of the hatchet were heard on the floor where the fascie had been spread. Next day, Pugliesa, who also had the reputation of being a witch, went to the mother, saying she was in great pain because during the night she had received many strokes on her back. Giovanna Petroni rejoiced in her deed of the previous night, but marvelled greatly that the woman Pugliesa was still alive after so many strokes of the hatchet on her spine. To get rid of her she gave her a pot of lard, and all else that she had, telling her story to everyone. But, notwith- standing this, the baby died. This was in 1870.

On her head she carried the cofano (vessel) in which was the meal for her husband, who was the thresher. The lark saw her, hopped towards her slowly, to show he could be easily caught, and the dog hid himself under a bush. When the lark was near, the woman put down her cofano to catch the lark for her children. The moment she did this the dog came out of the bush, went to the cofano, and while the woman was of the bush, went to the cofano, and while the woman was trying to catch the lark the dog ate the meal. When he had enough the lark suddenly gave a start and flew away, and the woman in great shame returned to the village to fill her cofano again with new food.

By the white, rutty track there was a fringe of blue succory, the yellow thistly succory, mountain thistles, and succory, the yellow thistly succory, mountain thistles, and a few poppies, and beyond were the mountains and castle a few poppies, and beyond were the mountains and castle villages on their ridges, all glistening and shimmering in the hot atmosphere; beneath us the road zig-zagged into the valley, and we went down until we came to a burnt-up almond orchard. Then the road became almost level, and we drove through more almond orchards until on the top of the opposite ridge we saw the castle village of Castelvecchio. It looked almost as if the houses were part of the burnt-up mountainside, for their colour was only a little paler than the earth and they overhung the ridge in the most forbidding manner. We went on amongst the same burnt-up orchards and barren earth through which we had come down. The track zig-zagged up this ridge until it took a long curve to the right round the ridge, and looking up we saw the village above us. We passed another almond orchard, with a very old man and woman sitting in the trees cutting the branches, with glimpses of a in the trees cutting the branches, with glimpses of a white wall behind them, and then we came to the first houses. They overhung the ridge, and were a kind of outer entrance to the village. The track went half- way round, bringing us to an irregular square, partially surrounded with stones, ruins, and tumbledown houses. At the end of this square farthest from the valley there was a dark narrow passage, and this was the entrance to was a dark narrow passage, and this was the entrance to the castle village.

The gallery led to another narrow street like that by which we had entered, and right away at the other end of it there was a refreshing gleam of sünlight on an outer wall. Two other alleys crossed ours at right angles, but we first of all went to the end of the street we were in, before exploring them. When we came to the end we found that a little alley, sometimes wider and sometimes narrower, went round the village, the three alleys which crossed the main alley leading into the three alleys which crossed the main alley leading into it at each end. We next went to explore the transverse ways. They were all steps and archways, and there were Venetian-looking windows, carved mouldings, and here and there a good capital of a broken pillar. The whole place was just like some great mediæval castle with galleries and underground passages, and must be little changed and underground passages, and must be little changed since the days of the Medici.

We explored the whole village before I decided what to sketch, and there were so many interesting and extraordinary corners that it was difficult to choose. Wherever one turned there were archways, galleries, steps, mouldings, and windows. Finally I decided on the alley with the steps, partly because we could not stay very long and it was fairly simple, and partly because in doing it I could sit on a flight of steps out of reach of the clamouring peasants and, Thoped, also of the fleas. Before beginning we looked at the church, by the other alley which surrounded the village. It was queer and uneven, built by the side of a rock, and it had corners, angles, and pillars in all sorts of unexpected places. At the uneven end of the church, in a recess which faced west, there was a very elaborate high altar covered with gold. It had carved pillars, flowers, and leaves all gilded, and was very fantastic and quite in keeping with the queer place. To the left there was another large altar much in the same style but not quite so rich, and there were lustre candelabra and curious painted wooden chandeliers.

Boys climbed up the side of the steps, hanging on and looking over the edge, but when I had enough of them I had only to push their fingers and they half-jumped and half- tumbled to the bottom amidst shouts of laughter.

The son met with a gracious girl who out of pity undertook this fast, and the prince returned to his father's palace. The girl presented herself at the Court, worn with fasting, and hoped the king's son would marry her. But the prince, instead, spat in her face, saying,— And thou for a man hast suffered hunger! Go from here!\" The poor girl did not wait to be told twice, and wandered about the country sadly, until, over¬ whelmed by sleep, she sank under a tree.

The girl, on receiving the gift, took out all the precious stones, threw them to her chickens to pick up, saying she did not know what to do with them, and in return she sent a cucumber. The king's son was sad. \"Who is this woman?\" he asked. None could tell him, and he could not understand. He continued sending presents, but the girl did not come to the window. Finally, she sent word that, if he wished to see her, he must feign himself dead, be carried on a bier beneath her window, and then she would come to see him. The prince placed himself on a bier and was carried, with many followers, past the palace of the girl. When he passed beneath her window she came and spat in his face.

The Church of the Annunciata has a very elaborate façade, for each of the doorways is of a different design and has intricate mouldings round it, and whenever one looks at it one sees something fresh. There are many churches, and a museum with a ragged piece of tapestry which is supposed to be of great value. At the end of the main street were the ruins of a Roman aqueduct, and its arches went along one side of the market and also made shadows for various stalls. The numerous side streets, which had not been rebuilt, were still in- teresting. Many of the shops sold nothing but the corone of coloured sugar-plums of every size. Some of the small of coloured sugar-plums of every size. Some of the small ones cost only six sous, whilst others were six or seven francs. There were also many jewellers who showed us all kinds of odds and ends of peasant things, but they were mostly modern and the good old designs are fast being given up. Whenever we asked the price of anything we were asked how much we would give for it, and when we said we were not jewellers and did not know the value, the man always answered neither did he know the value, but if we would make an offer he would see if he could accept it. We replied that we could not waste time in bargaining, but the man would never name a price and we never got further than receiving his profuse bows when we passed his shop.

She was his lost bride, and on finding it she knew that, as it belonged to her bridegroom, this it she knew that, as it belonged to her bridegroom, this man must be he. In the morning, by virtue of the talis- man, they recognised each other. The two kings agreed to the marriage, and were especially pleased because the bridegroom had brought all the baskets full of money and every good gift of God.                                 "

I was awakened next morning by a flood of sunlight streaming in. I got up and, leaning out of the window, saw that the village of Scanno was some distance away and piled up on a hill. There was a background of mountains in a haze of light, the village standing out a tone darker in a haze of light, the village standing out a tone darker in front of them, but also bathed in light shining through the haze and the smoke which came from the houses. Down below was a road leading to the valley, which was also hazy with mist and sun, and it gave me quite à queer sensation to see that there were trees, so accustomed had I become to the barren mountains. Downstairs I met the two women and the priest, who said he expected me to be ill after sleeping with the window open. The women were as silent as they had been the night before, and looked as sallow and dark. They were working, and, according to custom, had their full skirts tied up below the waist round the bustle at the edge of their bodices. This made a roll about nine inches thick just below the waist, and the full skirts having many pleats made them the more bulky. When the skirts are fastened in this manner they scarcely come as far as the knees, and when the peasants walk along they have a queer swinging movement from side to side. The bodices which go with this costume are always black with full sleeves, and there are eleven little silver buttons in front, each peasant having à different design.

One sister was beautiful, the second had a humped back and was very ugly, and the third was mentally deficient. I do was very ugly, and the third was mentally deficient. I do not think a day passed without something happening, and they certainly had every reason to believe I had the evil eye.

The fifth day four models, one after another, were ill and had to leave. The sixth day the ugly sister, who was jealous, threatened to shoot her beautiful sister, because she was engaged, and she had to run away. All these things actually happened. The father, a roadmender, was away in the mountains mending a road. One day the ugly sister came to me and said,—\"Help me to shoot my sister. She is going to be married, and she will steal the money and the linen. Tsaid,—\" Thou canst not prevent her from being married.

I told her to speak the truth for once in her life, if she knew what truth meant. She begged me to tell her if she knew what truth meant.

He had called a friend who was said to be a doctor, and they asked me to wait while they saw the sick daughter.

Her relations and friends were seated by her, some knitting, others talking or feeding their children, or dragging the older children out of the way of the guests who were still arriving. We were told that in former days the bride held her rosary in her lap and looked at it, but that now she has a handkerchief instead. After we had also sat with our backs against the wall talking to the peasants next us for a time, the bridegroom came and shook hands with us, and told us who he was. Then he carried round, first a tray of little cakes which he offered to everyone, and then a tray of little glasses of liqueur, but he never spoke to the bride, who amidst the noise made by the guests still gazed in silence at her handker- chief. The women who knitted had the silver hooks on their left shoulders on which the thread is hooked, and some of their clasps were of a very good design, and had frogs and horns and crescents to keep away the evil eye. After we had been sitting there some time we thought we would go downstairs, for it was getting very hot and stuffy, and we went out into the street. We found it crowded with peasants, all waiting to see the bride and bridegroom go to the church, and we also waited with them.

We passed the little alley near which I had been working, and on the same doorstep where she had been sitting all day, there was still the old widow with her face bound up in a faded red handkerchief instead of the usual black. She was blind and could scarcely move, and sat with her hands clasping her heavy staff, and on her left shoulder the chicken who always perched there sat on one leg in a ruffled heap.

She said if he liked us he would shout to us to approach. After about half-an-hour a path branched off to the right. On one side of it there a path branched off to the right. On one side of it there was a bank covered with great bushes of gorgeous broom in full flower, behind which was a background of blue and purple mountains. On the left was a small wooden shelter.

Some minutes later the lower doorway was thrown open, and the old man, stepping over his sheep, which filled the stable and slept in the upper storey, came out to us. He bowed, took off his hat, and said,— Strangers from a far country, ye wish to speak with me. I cannot tell ye any- thing.

In a few minutes the astrologer came with his treasure. It was bound in vellum and yellow with age, and the leaves were old and brown, and the ink also brown. He opened the book saying,—What dost thou want to know?' and after looking at it a short time he said,— This il giorno di giove\" (Thursday).

Amongst the pages were several prints of saints and angels which he had kept, and on the pages were drawings of the signs he had kept, and on the pages were drawings of the signs of the zodiac, and we saw that it was an old book of astrology.

We had seen nothing of the road coming up, for it was dark and there was no moon. After we had passed the lake the vegetation came to an end, the way becoming wild and barren. We went by the rocks where most of the serpents are caught for the serpent procession, which also takes place at Scanno, and then we came to the first hamlet. The Scannese had told us that the people there were wild and savage, and that it was not safe to go. Near the village we saw women washing clothes in stagnant water in the middle of the stony waste. The village was a short distance beyond, and it was irregular and tumbledown like all the other and it was irregular and tumbledown like all the other hamlets, and, like them also, it was built of the stone of the country, so that it looked as though it were part of the stony desert.

The perpendicular mountain side went sheer down five or six hundred feet into the torrent, and all along the summit of the mountain was one row of houses, which formed the village street. The church was at one end, washing hung from the win- dows of the houses, and now and then a face appeared gazing down the precipice. There was nothing to keep the children at the windows from falling straight into the torrent. Further on we came to the desert of S.

On the left the water reflected the blue sky, and bending over it we saw the sand at the bottom; patches of it were all pebbles, and the sand at the bottom; patches of it were all pebbles, and others were masses of thick green weed. Reeds grew along the edge, except where the boulders went straight down into the water.

He said, close by, Circe Maggiore would be full of interest for us, and we promised to go if we had the opportunity. Meanwhile he told us that in the house of Giarrocco, about one and a half 'miles from Circe, it is believed that there is a treasure. Gaetana Gesualda, who died near on forty years ago, was anxious to secure it, and went to the house. On her arrival the door suddenly opened itself. She entered, and at the farther end of the house found a staircase, which she descended. At the bottom she found a big room, in which there were three persons, each sitting on a barrel.

Everyone is now afraid of passing near the house at mid-day, or during night, because at these times the three damned people come out. Everybody is convinced about the existence of the treasure. Another time a pacchiana (a peasant woman), who is still living, passed near the house and found a celma (small sack) filled with blackened silver coins (scudi). She put it on her head to take it to the farm, but a well-dressed person appeared and shot out a flame from his mouth, got hold of the silver, and disappeared.

Near to Circe at Santa Maria al Monte (now in ruins), there is said to be a buried treasure. Four artisans wanted to get this treasure, and went to the church to send away the evil spirits which guarded it.

To get to Castel del Sangro from Anversa, we had a long way to go, and we decided to take the train across country and stop on the way for some hours to see Pescocostanzo. We passed several villages piled up with their church or castle towers at the top, and then we gradually went higher and higher up into the mountains. We went through a mountain desert of stones. Far beneath us was the valley with the villages we had seen, and the green of the sparse fields and trees were changed to and the green of the sparse fields and trees were changed to blue by the atmosphere. The stony ridges were of every shade of browns, greys, and yellows, and seemed to stretch away for ever. About mid-day we arrived at Pescocostanzo. The stationmaster asked us why we got out, and what we wanted. We said we wished to see the village and the lace for which it is celebrated. \"But why do you come here,\" he said, and then added sarcastically,- It is a beautiful place, with theatres and music and fish to eat.

Get in it and it will take you there, or go down the road in the opposite direction and you will go somewhere else. They are all the same. You can choose.\" We got in and the driver took us along. We could see some short grass on the ridges, but the back- ground of mountains was blotted out with fast descending clouds, and within ten minutes it was pouring in torrents. It was the only wet day we had the whole time we were away, and the sound of the rain splashing against the windows and the smell of dampness were delicious. To explore the village we had to walk through veritable lakes. Some of the houses were interesting, with deep eaves, carved and painted brackets, gargoyles, and old doors standing back in recesses with steps leading up to them. Then we went to see the bishop. We were shown into a fairly large room with a brick floor and numerous beautiful venetian chairs of different designs, carved, gilded, and painted. I think I counted sixteen in all. There were also other rather good pieces of furniture. The peasant girl who showed us in told us to be seated, and after a few moments brought us two cups of hot coffee, and said that Monsignore was just awake and would come. In a few minutes a stout dignified man with a kindly quiet face entered the room. He was simple and without affectation. He shook hands, told my father to remain covered, and asked us to be seated. He was very different from others we had met, and, as he sat there talking in his quiet way, his fine head reminded me of Holbein.

These are drawn by a couple of white oxen yoked together (without a cart) to the entrance of the church. With the wood a fire is made, lighted by striking flints. The fire burns all night, and around it the youths pass the night, singing, dancing, and keeping it alight. At dawn lovers take the brands and put them down before the door of their beloved, and then retire. The girl's mother, who is the first to rise, opens the door, finding the brand.

The path was steep, and as we went round its bend we saw the cyclopic walls holding up the banks. They were built of such immense stones that no one knows how it was possible to get them there and build them together. The tradition is that they are \"Mura Ciclopiche, 1.e. walls built by the cyclops, though some say it was the Etruci (Etruscans).

Doorways and steep steps led straight up from the streets, but most of the shops had neither doors nor windows, the whole of the shop being open to the street. The sleeping, cooking, and ordinary work of the shop were all going on at the same time. Some of the upper windows to the houses had arrange- ments of wooden trellis which reminded us of harems, and these trellises looked as if they were made to slide along. In one shop I saw the same arrangement down- stairs to shut off the back from the front part of the room. Op one street almost every house had, by the side of the door which was in use, another small door which was barricaded up. We asked what this meant, and were told that the barricaded door was that used for a coffin to come out of the house.

Delle bisce morte non aver paura. Do not touch those alive, Quelle vive non le toccare, They will bite thee. Che ti possono morssicare. -Scanno and Cocullo. NE day we went to see the little village of Cocullo, two hours' away by train from Sulmona. Just as we arrived we met a procession of pilgrims who had been on a four days' pilgrimage into the mountains, and on their return had been to visit the image of S. Domenico, the local patron saint who protects from tooth- ache, hydrophobia, and serpent bites. The pilgrims walked along two by two, and all the women had handker- chiefs of every shade of orange and green. They also had coce (shoes) (page 189), and each carried a terra-cotta pot or flask for water, sometimes in the shape of a large fish, and sometimes decorated with designs in relief. Each peasant woman must carry a burden, which is represented by bundles slung over their shoulders on sticks. These bundles were wrapped round with rags and contained a few provisions. Some of the women had staves. The bareheaded men also had their bundles. One of them went at the head of the procession carrying an immense crucifix, and some others also had crosses or else had very long staves with a small bit 293                                             "

A tall woman with a very long thick stick for keeping the peasants in order a very long thick stick for keeping the peasants in order walked at the end of the procession. We were told that they still had three more days to walk, and, that now they sleep on the mountain side ' à la belle étoile, and that formerly they were allowed to sleep in the churches, but stole so much that this no longer permitted. We were also told that it is the right thing to wear orange handker- chiefs on a pilgrimage. We went next to the church to see the statue of the saint. In one hand he holds a small mule-shoe, which is the symbol of his power to cure toothache, and when in the procession he has in the other hand a representation of one of the saint's teeth. The Archiprete Loreto Marchione told us that S. Domenico of Cocullo, or of Sora, was born at Foligno in Umbria, A.D. 950, and died at Sora, January 22nd, A.D. 1031. He was of the Order of S. Benedict, and founded several convents in the valleys and mountains of the Abruzzi, but he never remained in them. He used to assemble the monks, elect their chief, and then retire to live the life of an anchorite in a cavern. He founded a monastery at Cocullo, and stayed there some time, per¬ forming many miracles. When he left the people en- treated him to leave something of himself to protect them from misfortune, venomous serpents, hydrophobia, and toothache. He consented, and, as a gift, he pulled out one of his teeth, and presented it to the inhabitants, together with a shoe from his she-mule. With the mule-shoe the peasants used to brand their arms, as a preventive of toothache and hydrophobia from the bites of mad dogs. There are also small mule-shoes which are kept only as a devozione. With them women                                   "

Domenico, Cocullo. Pilgrims journey practically all the year round to this sanctuary, and on the 15th of August, and 15th of September, great crowds go to the festa of S. Domenico for protection from or cure of hydrophobia, serpent bites, and toothache. Shepherds also lead their sheep and dogs to Cocullo pastures to a certain tree, and this decides their fate. At a certain point, if they make suspicious movements they a certain point, if they make suspicious movements they are doomed, and must be killed. We were also told that no one from the village has ever been bitten by a serpent or mad dog, and that it is impossible for anyone to be or mad dog, and that it is impossible for anyone to be harmed in the village; that if anyone is wounded outside the village he has only to enter it to be cured immediately, or to die at once. There are numerous local legends about the saint. S. Domenico also went to Scanno, and when he was riding Giulia, his she-mule, on his way back to Cocullo she lost one of her shoes. At Cocullo S. Domenico begged the village farrier to shoe Giulia for God's sake, for he had to leave next day, and had not a farthing. The blacksmith shod Giulia, but afterwards asked to be paid for so doing. S. Domenico, having nothing, entreated him to let him go, for God's sake. \"God's sake is no him to let him go, for God's sake. \"God's sake is no good to me, I want money !\" was the reply. S. Domenico turned then to his mule,—Giulia, leave the shoes. I cannot pay for them. I have nothing!\" Giulia left the shoes at once on the ground, and S. Domenico went away with her shoeless.

Domenico took pity, and one night watched the wolf go over the pass, stopped her, and turned her into the wolf go over the pass, stopped her, and turned her into stone. This stone is now to be seen on the top of the mountain above Cocullo. The sacristan of Cocullo told us that on one of his journeys the saint wished to avoid his persecutors, and passed through the fields of Castro Valdo. His enemies, anxious to catch him, came to Castro Valdo and asked the peasants whether they had seen any monk. The peasants, peasants whether they had seen any monk. The peasants, „ who at that time were sowing beans, answered, \"Yes. 6 How long ago?\" asked the persecutors. \"Oh! during the sowing of our beans!\" answered the peasants. S. the sowing of our beans!\" answered the peasants. S. Domenicos enemies looked at the beans; they were in flower, and they concluded it was useless to search any more; S. Domenico must have passed a long while before. When S. Domenico instituted the convent at Villalago, for a time he lived in a grotto about two miles from Villalago, and his food was sent to him by the convent. One day, the cook, as a surprise, sent him some fried fish, fresh from the lake. The boy who took the fishes was so tempted by the delicious smell that on his way to the grotto he hid them in the hole of an oak tree, intending after his visit to S. Domenico to make a good meal off them. He gave S. Domenico the usual brown bread, and returned at once to the oak tree. No sooner did he put his hands in the hole than he got severely bitten, all the fishes attacking him. In fright, with his hands bleeding, he rushed back to S. Domenico, begging his pardon. he rushed back to S. Domenico, begging his pardon. S. Domenico made him do penance, and pardoned him. The festa of S.

Near the church a platform is erected with oak leaves and branches round it to repre- sent a wood. On one side of the platform a big sheet is hung. A procession with bands playing, and people with serpents, carries a statue of S. Domenico and places it behind the sheet. A woodman and his wife and another man bring a baby in a cradle made of twigs. With a hatchet, the woodman begins to chop up the branches, and his wife, leaving the cradle with the baby, goes round to gather the wood and twigs cut by her husband. They are so absorbed in their work that neither pays any attention to the cradle. A man disguised with skins to represent a to the cradle.

The father picks it up and gives it to the mother, who presses it to her bosom, kissing it all over the mother, who presses it to her bosom, kissing it all over again and again, and weeping with joy. The wolf lies again and again, and weeping with joy. The wolf lies down, and is seized with terrible convulsions, and the woodman, taking advantage, strikes it with a hatchet until it dies. The crowd shout in chorus,—Viva S. Domenico! Viva S. Domenico!\" The procession is again formed. The woodman and his wife, carrying the cradle and the baby on her head, follow the statue and enter the church and kneel at the altar’s first step.

Antonio the Hermit, the Madonna, and S. Rocco and his dog are all in the proces- sion. Peasants and pilgrims from many villages follow singing and chanting. Then comes the statue of S.

After Mass the serpents are taken away, counted, and each of the serpari is paid so much per head when he has taken them to the fields and killed them. There is a small slit in front of the statue for offerings, and silver hearts, plaits of hair, and other ex votos have been hung near it. During the procession the women kneel frequently and touch the ground with their finger tips, and kiss their fingers to the statue. 1 painted the end of the procession when the saint had been returned to the church and the last serpents were being taken off him. (Plate XXII.) The archiprete stood in front with a tooth of S. Domenico, and a little to the left of the statue there was a fairly large bell hanging on a long chain. During the Mass before the procession the peasants were continually ringing this bell by catching hold of the chain with their teeth. This was to ensure them against tooth- ache and dog bites. After the procession amulets of all sorts were sold, the women having them spread out on stalls, or on trays hanging from their necks. There were chicken feathers dyed red, purple, and green to keep away the evil eye, and sold in bunches of three bound together the evil eye, and sold in bunches of three bound together with wire, and also small square pieces of linen on which the image of S.

Domenico’s earth), which is supposed to be the sweepings from the sanctuary. Peasants fill their the sweepings from the sanctuary. Peasants fill their handkerchiefs with this and take it to sprinkle on their land as a preventive against locusts and plagues, and on the night of Good Friday the walls of chapels are cleaned, the dust collected, put aside, and taken at meals for illness, in small doses with coffee, broth, or water. These scrapings are also put in small bags, and given as ex votos. They are also buried with the dead. Sometimes, when anyone is ill, the relations even rasp the image of S. Domenico, and, if the ill person dies, the dust is put in a bag and buried with the corpse. The serpents for the procession are collected by the serpari at the end of April and beginning of May, princi- pally in the Valley Marzia and Cauta and Veècia. They are caught either by the neck or by their tails. The serpari irritate them by giving them their hats to bite, and then on suddenly withdrawing the hats all their teeth come out, and they are rendered innocuous. With the serpents' saliva the serpari cure bites, and they also kill the serpents to make and sell antidotes to the poison. When the serpents' teeth are out, they are kept cool, and are put in pits and buried, with a small opening. The first serpent is made to enter by its head, the others by their tails, otherwise the first would attack the others. It is not possible to take them out by the tail, the others.

Most of the peasants wore immense elongated heart-shaped silver clasps five or six inches in length, with complicated designs, which were fastened to their shoulders to hold up their richly-embroidered, gold and silver lace- covered bodices. These bodices were very brilliant, and they also had rosettes and bows of different coloured ribbons all down the sleeves. The peasants wore two or three rows of gold and silver beads, and they had gold earrings hanging right down on to their shoulders. Most of the earrings were large crescents and stars, and I saw one woman with a big triangle of gold hanging under the crescent. They wore rings on their fingers, and the crescent. They wore rings on their fingers, and altogether they gave one the impression of being covered with gold and silver and colour. The headdresses were quite small, white handkerchiefs with wide borders of rich lace. Some of them were a deep cream colour, but 1 saw one blue one with orange stripes. Later on in the day, just before Mass, the market place became even more crowded with peasants buying and selling and amusing themselves at the different swings and other entertain- ments. After a time a queer dark man in a long old brown coat set up a broken chair on a stand. On the ground in front of it he put a small cardboard box. He said his wife was a clairvoyant and called her. She mounted the platform, sat on the chair, and the man blindfolded her eyes with a handkerchief. A crowd of peasants encircled the platform, and then the man hypno- tised her, or pretended to do so, and she began muttering                                   "

There was a high cross on a stone pedestal, and steps round its base, and beyond on a stone pedestal, and steps round its base, and beyond were the cream and white plaster walls which encircled the convent garden. A door opened in this wall, and the Mother Superior, who was so old and bent that she could scarcely walk, tottered out. She was followed by nuns in white caps and grey gowns. They brought a chair and a table, and the Mother Superior sat down, bottles and a table, and the Mother Superior sat down, bottles and bandages were put on the table, and the nuns stood and bandages were put on the table, and the nuns stood round. Then the sick and the crippled, who had been sitting and lying by the roadside waving their broken and diseased limbs towards us and asking for alms, struggled up the steps to her to be attended to.

They had evidently come from a village very far away, and were more frightened and shy of us than any of the others. Their faces were rather thin and pointed and a deep olive, and quite different from any other types we had seen. The women had thick black hair parted neatly, and a white Eastern-looking material bound round a little above their foreheads and hanging down their backs in two long streamers. They had very coarse bulky skirts and bodices of brown woollen material, cut rather low, with standing-out pointed flaps and cuffs lined with scarlet, which they used as pockets. They had narrow, coloured aprons in front, and small aprons behind, also of some Eastern-looking stuff woven in coloured stripes. The whole costume, including the streamers of the head- dress, was bound down below the hips with a thick piece of a light blue kind of flannel. The women also had of a light blue kind of flannel.

They were from Gallo, and tradition tells how the origin of their costume was because a great sinking took place in the middle of the village, threatening its destruction. The population in despair made a vow henceforward to dress with the same cloth as that of the friars, but, as they did not fulfil their vow, the sinking came again, and stopped only when the vow was kept. On our way we passed a chapel with prints of hands on the plaster walls. They were all left hands, and only on one side of the chapel. I had noticed this in several vil¬ lages. It was explained to me that men and boys dip their hand in something black and then put it flat on the wall, to leave a print of the whole hand. They do this for luck when they grow up, or before going on a journey, or before marriage. In some cases some of the fingers were missing, and one or two had only the palm and the thumb. I believe occasionally they make a print of the left hand before marriage, and then add the right hand after mar- riage, but the peasant who told me this did not want to say much about it, and was rather indefinite. He said that the village of S. Cosimo dolls are sold in the saint's honour, and all draw their hands on the church walls and on the entrance pavement, with pencil, chalk, or a nail, and they also write their names and the date. and they also write their names and the date.

She described how, at Lent, a puppet is made up of black rags about twenty inches high, with a ring inside the skirt on which are hung samples of the food eaten during Easter,—cod, bloaters, crowns of dried figs, chestnuts, and a small bottle of oil. An orange or a potato is hung in the centre, with seven feathers stuck in it. These are pulled out on each con- secutive Sunday. In its hand the puppet holds a distaff and hemp, which is taken away on Sabbato Santo (Easter Saturday). Carnival is also represented by a woman doll cut out of paper with seven feet, one of which is taken away every Sunday. It is put under the chimney with a basket of fish over its head and a distaff at the side (S. Pelino). Sometimes a doll with seven feathers is hung from a rope between two houses. In some villages the puppet is made of an orange, a doll’s head, and forty feathers stuck in for the skirt.

On the last day of Carnival, the Carnival figure is dressed as a shepherd in sheepskin and large hat, with a stick. The Easter figure is dressed in old worn-out clothes with a frying pan.

On Easter Day, before eating the pizza and the other food, à paternoster is said. At S. Biagio, wine bottles, bread, and salt are blessed during Mass. On Giovedi Santo (Holy Thursday), pots of corn, lentils, flax, and lupins are taken to the Easter Sepulchre in the church.
