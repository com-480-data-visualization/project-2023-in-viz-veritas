            "TO THE READER. MY aim in the following pages is, to describe Italy exactly as it is :—making men and manners the principal objects of my attention, without neglecting any thing that is worthy of notice in the face of the country : never exaggerating the beautiful or the disagreeable; not wholly discarding enthusiasm, but never, 1 hope, suffering it to lead me essentially astray ; speaking freely of abuses, but not wilfully calumniating. To eloquence of description or the graces of style,—those excellencies which peculiarly mark the compositions of the present age, T have no pretensions: but Thope to compensate in some degree for                "

My desire is to inculcate real liberality, —to see independence established wherever it can maintain itself, and liberty planted wherever it will grow. These few words contain my political creed. My religious spirit is that of toleration,—but, (1 trust) not of indifference : and I abhor the despotism of priests, almost as cordially as that of military tyrants. I must request the reader not to lose sight of the date of my journey. I visited Italy at a sad time, and I hope to God that much of the misery which I then witnessed no longer exists.

The very appearance of such a carriage engages the good-will of the post-masters and the post-boys, and the post-masters and the post-boys, and affords the traveller the best chance of being driven cheerfully and rapidly along: whilst a heavy clumsy-looking vehicle is criticised and complained of at every sta¬ tion ; and is made the pretext for every delay, whether occasioned by the laziness of the postillion, or the feebleness of the horses. There is another inconvenience which travellers often inflict upon themselves, against which we had been careful to guard ; I mean, a superfluity of luggage. A number of loose parcels and packages is a positive and serious evil on a long journey. The space which they occupy, and the care which they require, are an annoyance as long as they happen to be preserved ; and the gradual and successive loss of them, which inevitably takes place at every inn on the road, is a source of continual vexation and regret.

We slept at Evian. The next morning being rainy, we were for some time de- prived of the magnificent prospect from the publick walk called the Terrasse; but the weather soon cleared up, and we were the weather soon cleared up, and we were pleased beyond measure with the scenery on the road to St. Gingoux. A beautiful lake on the left; on the right, high moun- tains, under the shelter of which arose a range of diversified hills, crowned with old castles, towers, churches, villages, and pea¬ sants cottages ; nearer at hand, fields and meadows, adorned with the most pic- turesque of European trees—the chestnut ; all combined to render this part of our journey in the highest degree delightful, and to make us wish that the scenery of Italy might not charm us less than that of the country between Evian and St. Gingoux.

Frequent falls of enormous rocks from the summits of the impending mountains ; immense accumulations of ice and snow which threaten the hopes of every year, and often overwhelm and de- stroy in an instant the collected produce of painful labour, and of persevering indus¬ try* ; an ungrateful soil ; an unwholesome climate ; all these warnings have been given in vain. Man has perversely braved them in vain. Man has perversely braved them all ; and the seal of his punishment seems to have been stamped on the disgusting countenances of a great part of the popu¬ lation of this ill-omened country. No sight can be imagined more repulsive than the moving masses of flesh and blood which continually meet the eye ; unless it be * A huge rock had lately rolled down across the high- way, and so completely obstructed the passage, that it had been necessary to cut a new road around it.

The waterfall of Pissevache is a fine ob¬ ject, and well deserves to be examined, though it is not comparable to any of the three falls of the Reichenbach, in the valley of Meyringen*. It has, however, this great advantage,—that it may be closely approached, and seen in profile; in which point of view, a cascade appears in its greatest beauty.

At length 1 was fortunate enough to attract the notice of a peasant, whom 1 called to my assistance, and by whose guidance and aid I was extricated from this awkward situation. It was completely dark when we arrived at Sion, where we rested for the night.

His care, however, was rendered superflu- ous. We incurred no risk of being sur- prised in our sleep; for we were kept awake till day-light, by a German and his wife, who lay in an adjoining room, and who were loudly disputing at intervals, during the whole of the night, which of them the whole of the night, which of them                             "

The next morning before breakfast, we walked up a pretty high hill near the town, to examine the noble ruins of two castles in the midst of most picturesque scenery. The ascent to them is extremely steep ; and we returned from our excursion exhausted with hunger and fatigue. Thiere was an incon- venience in this, of which we had not an¬ ticipated the full extent: for not only was the inn so crowded that we had great dif¬ ficulty in procuring any breakfast at all; but we found it prudent to leave half¬ finished even the very bad meal which had been set before us, in order that we might get the start of Lord and Lady Cowper and their family, who were travelling the same road, and by whose pre-occupation of the post-horses, if we had suffered them to precede us, our progress must have been considerably delayed.

At the distance of a mile or two from Sierre, he fell in with a friend of his, who ran on foot by the side of the horses, for the sake of conversation. We heard them talking with great earnestness of the reported arrest of a person at Sion, whom I soon recognized a person at Sion, whom I soon recognized from their description to be the same indi¬ vidual whom I had observed at the inn on the preceding evening. Having reached Brig in good time, we resolved to walk to the other side of the Rhone before dinner; and the fineness of the evening tempted us to prolong our excursion. We passed through the village of Maters, and ascended a hill of a re¬ of Maters, and ascended a hill of a re¬ markably picturesque appearance, where we found a most beautiful waterfall, form¬ ed by the Yelchbach. The number of streams into which the river divides, and the almost impenetrable thickets through which they flow, made it impossible to ap¬ proach the foot of the cascade ; so that we could only admire it at a distance.

N had not been able to follow me in my ascent,—his imperfect recovery from a lameness having obliged him to restrain a lameness having obliged him to restrain his ardour for pedestrian enterprises ; and he began to be seriously alarmed at my stay, the noise of the waterfall having pre¬ vented him from hearing my answers to his repeated shouts. The sun had already set ere I succeeded (by dint of rolling and tumbling down the precipice) in rejoining him in safety; and I resolved that this should be the last adventure of the kind. But the cascade of the Yelchbach is a delightful spot, and well deserves a travel¬ ler’s notice. On our way back to Brig, we had the snowy summits of Ganters in our view, still tinged with the last rays of the sun, which imparted to them that exquisite rosy tint so                             "

The inn, which was empty on our arrival, had by this time filled to such a degrée, that poor Madame Calvet, our land¬ lady, hardly knew what she was about. Our dinner had been given, in our absence, to other travellers; and that which she had prepared to replace it, we requested her to give to Lord Cowper's children, who were still less able than we were to suffer the pains of hunger. We received a visit in the evening from Mr. L—, a Welsh gentleman, whom I had known in Switzerland, and who came to propose that we should form a caravan for the next day, as there was a caravan for the next day, as there was great probability that we should be attacked by robbers, if we crossed the Simplon in single carriages. He informed us that Mr. O—, an elderly gentleman who was travelling with his wife, had been on the point of engaging an Ita¬ lian courier at Geneva, whom he after¬                            "

To raise an humbled but generous foe, is, indeed, a noble act ; but to profess extravagant ad¬ miration for a cruel despot, the avowed enemy of freedom and of every liberal sen¬ timent, is unworthy of the inhabitants of a frée country. If the road over the Simplon were the first work of the kind ever thought of, one might, though detesting the character, ad¬ mire the genius, of the man who had de¬ signed and accomplished it. But there existed previously many other roads of the same description, some of them much more admirable, when considered with reference to the great disparity of the means with which they were accomplished,—a circum¬                           "

Buonaparte ordered some hundreds of his slaves to cut a road over the Simplon, similar to those which existed in several other parts of the Alps and Apennines. It cost him, perhaps, sixty or eighty of his men, who were crushed by the falling of some of the galleries, or blown into the air by the blasting of the rocks. What was that to him—who, according to his own account, had a disposable annual income of 120 or 150,000 lives ?

But I have an habitual distrust of these gentry ; so we stopped him, and, going quietly ourselves, at eight o'clock, we succeeded in hiring a box for seven franks. The tickets are a separate charge, and cost each a frank and a half: this astonishingly cheap, in comparison with English prices; but the subscriptions are still cheaper, and do not amount to more than five soldi, or French sous, for an evening. It is true, that what are called the house-expenses of this theatre are comparatively trifling. There are, for in¬ are comparatively trifling.

In the pit, there are seats for about 600 persons, and stand¬ ing-room for 400 more; the proportion of space for the latter is larger than in French or English theatres, because the pit, in those of Italy, like the Exchange in a com¬ mercial town, is a place of general resort, where you can hardly fail to find at some hour of the evening whomsoever of your acquaintance you may wish to speak to. Hence there is a great deal of intercourse and circulation amongst this part of the audience; which would not be easily prac- ticable, if the whole space were occupied by benches. This constant moving and talking, is very unpleasant to a stranger, who comes to the theatre for the purpose of listening to the performance; but it may be observed, on the other hand, that as the same opera is usually performed every evening for a whole month, the plot of the pièce ceases, after the second or third                            "

But when we arrived at Milan, it had not been changed for six weeks, the piece being the first attempt of a young composer whom the Milanese warmly patronized because he had studied amongst them. His name is he had studied amongst them. His name is Soliva, that of the opera, La Testa di Bronzo, (the Brazen Head), a wretched French me¬ lo-drama. The composition is in my opi¬ nion far from a good one; nor can I even entertain the hopes of some, whose indulg- ence persuaded them that it gave promise of better musick hereafter. Soliva appears to have talent, but no genius: he under¬ stands the rules, the theory, and the prac¬ tice of musick ; but he has no ideas of his own. His work is a compilation of a multitude of half-passages, taken at random from all the operas that he has seen or heard. In other compilations one meets with entire passages borrowed and put to- gether, which form a sort of mosaick, and sometimes produce a good effect. But Soliva breaks them off in the middle; and this expedient far from answering the pur¬ pose of disguise, only tantalizes the hearer with constant appeals to his memory, with- with constant appeals to his memory, with-                           "

Two pieces, however, pleased me very well; the bass air, which was beautifully sung by Remorini, and a duett in the second act, which, on the whole, is much better than the first. Soliva has adopted the German style of musick; which if superior to the Italian in instrumental, is certainly far inferior in vocal effect. The prima Donna, Signora Fabrè, is handsome, and sings very well; but the theatre is too large for the compass of any voice; and it would be unfair to judge of the merits of singers, from their mode of execution in a place where the full extent of their powers must be employed to make themselves heard. The serious ballet was very well performed, both as to dancing and pantomine.

When they are crowded and heaped together, they may amaze and over- power the senses ; but the impression which they leave upon the mind is not that of pleasure. Tancredi bears evident marks of poetical inspiration. The composition is original, warm and brilliant ; and peculiarly re¬ markable for that singleness and unifor- mity of style, which characterizes the works of the great masters, such as Cimarosa and Paësiello. Those musical phrases which are not in themselves new, are at least turned in so new a manner, and disguised under such an air of originality, that they are become the indisputable property of the composer. Tancredi's cavatina, his two duetts, the aria of Argyro, and the two finales are all admirable. The part of Tan¬ credi was sustained by a female.

It may be supposed, at first thought, that the part of a hero must be spoilt in the hands of a woman ; but in my opinion the hero of an opera is infinite¬ ly more interesting under this form. No¬ body can look for perfect illusion in an opera; and while a female voice certainly finds its way to the heart more easily than that of a man, there is still a sufficient difference between the two characters of voice, the contralto and the soprano, to preserve that degree of illusion, which is absolutely necessary to guard against the ridiculous. The tenor of course is not on that account discarded; and the part of Argyro, to which it falls, is far from being neglected. The whole was extremely well sung, especially by the two ladies and the tenor, who were excellent artists. Between the acts of the opera there was a ballet, danced by what the Italians call a ballet, danced by what the Italians call Groteschi. I ought not, however, to say danced, because it was very unlike that graceful art: I should rather say, whirled and jumped ; for it consisted entirely of such extravagant leaps and feats of agility, as to                            "

The imposing sight of so many splendid pa- laces fills the mind, at the first glance, with admiration and surprise, and leaves no room for calm reflection.

Several of these palaces were never finished; others were never inhabited; a much greater number have, of late years, been deserted ; and most of those which are still inhabited, are miserably neglected, and out of repair.

Nei¬ ther can any one who has just visited Verona, be surprised to find Vicenza deserted ; or attribute the decay of its population and prosperity to the ruin of fifty or sixty noble¬ men. There must be a deeper, and a more melancholy cause. It is the hand of military despotism, whoseiron grasp has crushed the energies of a country where the genius of peace, with its attributes the arts and sci¬ ences, ought for ever to have held its in¬ vigorating and beneficent sway. Judging from appearances, Ishould say, that least one half of the inhabitants of Vicenza is reduced to positive mendicity ; the beggars are numerous beyond any con¬ ception that I could have formed from mere description ; and they seem horribly wretched. Can it be really true, that instead of lending succour to this starving pro¬ vince, its government draws from it con¬ siderable sums to remit to Austria ?

The treasures of Italy are the sacred property of Italy ; of Italy are the sacred property of Italy ; and in a year of scarcity, when those riches are indispensable not to the com¬ fort alone but to the very existence of their real owners, it would be an act of such cruel despotism to divert any part of them to foreign countries, that I must think the charge a calumny. Indeed, it must be owned that the Austrian Government is but too much exposed to such calumnies, from the peculiarity of its situation ; and it would require the exertion of greater talents and higher virtues than are generally to be met with in Courts, to preserve it from the hatred and malediction of its new subjects. The French were execrated ; and well they deserved it : there can be no doubt but that any change from their yoke seemed de¬ sirable to the Lombards: and had a vear of plenty accompanied the last revolution, had a succession of publick fêtes and re¬ joicings ushered in the new Sovereign in a manner more agreeable to the character                            "

This scenery would be enchanting, even in the midst of St. Petersburgh; and there is nothing either in London or Paris, that can bear the least comparison to it. Strangers have, in general, a very in¬ correct idea of Venice. They imagine that the houses are almost all so many islands; or at least that everv single street forms an island, and that there is no com¬ munication with the next street except by water. This not the case: there are bridges every where ; and you may live in Venice twenty years, and go to every part of it (except an island or two which form a sort of suburbs,) without ever making use of a boat. I never took a gondola but once, and that was to go over to the island of St. George and to the Giudeca ; and I am sure I rambled about the town and visited every part of it, more than any individual of my acquaintance.

To me a gondola looked very like a coffin; which to my taste is of all things the most disagreeable. One circumstance renders walking about Venice excessively uncomfortable. The numberless bridges are built extremely lofty, in order to allow the boats a free pas¬ sage under them; and this particularity which, in itself, is sufficiently inconvenient. is rendered much more so by the flights of steps on each side of them.

The streets or lanes are paved with flat stones; and are comfortable enough in dry weather; but when it rains they are soon covered with water and mud. On the whole it may be said that Venice is not a pleasant town for those who are fond of long walks and bodily exercise ; but for mere loungers, the por¬ ticoes round the place of San Marco are sufficiently spacious, and extremely agreeable. * This particularly the case with both sides of the Rialto, which is the only considerable bridge in Venice, having two rows of shops in its whole length: they form three parallel lines or streets, the middle one has steps of a comfortable height and breadth, but the side ones are like those of the other bridges.

It is miserable food, but five or six slices during the day, are sufficient to keep body and soul together. The other sort is called Zucca Santa: it is more substantial, less insipid, and proportionally dearer; and is the favourite and usual food of that portion of the lower classes who are just above begging.

There were several painters of very great eminence, in what is called the Venetian School; but all of them, as it appears to me, had some peculiar ble¬ mishes, which in a great measure spoil the effect of their works and diminish their lustre. The first and most glaring of their defects was, that of always copying from individual nature, instead of working upon their own conceptions of ideal beauty. Their figures, whatever might be the sub¬ were invariably ject they were treating, portraits of Venetian gentlemen and ladies. They are in consequence remarkable for a certain sameness of feature and expression, which stamp them at once as individuals of the same nation. The women are almost universally represented with too short a face, and too prominent a nose,—which are obvious peculiarities in the Venetians. In the living specimens, these defects are more the living specimens, these defects are more than compensated by the gracefulness of the attitudes and the animation of the counte¬ nances of the persons in whom they occur ; but these are charms for which motion and                            "

The second defect is nearly allied to the first : in order to please their employers, they almost always introduced contemporary portraits into their historical paintings, and those not the portraits of the hand¬ and those not the portraits of the hand¬ somest persons of the time, or of the fittest subjects for the pencil, but of their patrons and of their connexions, many of whom no painter could represent other¬ wise than exceedingly ugly. The third fault which I find with the Venetian school Tought perhaps to pass over in silence; for, as Tam no painter, I may be a very imper¬ fect judge of this part of the art. But by premising that, though a zealous amateur, I do not pretend to the character of a skilful connoisseur, I run no risk of misleading any one in recording my opinions. Ithink, then, that the colouring is too abrupt (if I may thus translate our French word tran- chant) ; the eye does not glide from one object to another, as in the beautifully smooth and mellow works of the Bo¬ lognese school; but is, on the contrary,                           "

THERE are six theatres in Venice; 1. The largest is that of San Chrysostome, which may contain 2,500 spectators : it has a very singular shape, being neither round nor oval: that part of the house which faces the stage is much broader than the rest, the stage is much broader than the rest, and contains eleven boxes in a straight line, together with two half-boxes at the corners, where the front and the side boxes join. This distribution produces a very awkward effect to the eye; but it is agree- able to have so many places in front. We found at this theatre a very bad set of actors, who performed operas. 2. The second in size, but the first in rank, is the theatre della Fenice, which is almost perfectly circular, and extremely                        "

The third, of San Benedetto, is oval, much inferior to the last in beauty, but équal in size and capacity. Here we wit¬ nessed a lamentable drama on the bom¬ bardment of Algiers; the scenery of which would not have been tolerated at Astley's, or Sadler’s Wells. 4. The theatre of San Luca is like the preceding, in size and in shape ; and was occupied by a company of comic actors, who performed tolerably well, though the prima Amorosa was neither young nor hand¬ some, and the Amoroso very unattractive. 5. The theatre of San Moisé is ugly and small; it holds hardly one thousand spec¬ tators; but the company who were then performing at it could not have attracted a larger audience, even in the largest a larger audience, even in the largest theatre in the city, though they performed Rossini's charming opera of Tancredi.

In the lower notes her voice was still very fine, though somewhat hard : and she had the agreeable qualification of articulating every syllable so distinctly, that I did not miss a single word of her part. Her face might have looked old in a woman's dress, but, in a sol¬ dier’s it seemed handsome and expressive. Her acting was decentand graceful. She did not indeed pique herself upon very nicely attending to the stage-directions. Her re¬ citation of the words “ Io ti baccio, ad¬ dressed to her native country, on landing, was uncommonly good, though unaccom¬ panied with any gesture that could indi¬ cate even the wish, much less the act of kissing the soil ; and when she afterwards sung with Argyro, these words, “ Ah ! if thou knewest whom thou pressest to thy thou knewest whom thou pressest to thy bosom,\" Argyro was at the other end of the stage, very far from indulging in such tendernesses.

In speaking of the theatres and the plays at Venice, Mr. La Lande says that nothing at Venice, Mr. La Lande says that nothing but downright farce and gross buffoonery would please in that city ; and that the taste of the people of Italy, and more par- ticularly that of the Venetians, had entirely banished tragical, and even serious, subjects from the stage. In consequence of these observations, which could not fail to please one who likes laughing much better than crying, I longed to see a comedy per¬ formed at Venice; and as one was an¬ nounced on the San Luca play-bill, “ tutta da ridere, —all for laughter,—I hastened to that theatre at an early hour to secure a                            "

At the end of a year, Carlo, tired of his captivity consents to the marriage, and is liberated just at the moment when Federico and his daughter Julia arrive at the Counts house for the purpose of concluding it. Now the supposed travels of the young bridegroom might have afforded matter for some amusing scenes ; but the author en¬ tirely neglects this opportunity of comic effect, and represents Carlo as so indignant at the manner in which he has been treated at the manner in which he has been treated that it is impossible to laugh at him.

But the little angels who accompany him, are the most charming that can be imagined.

Adeline has been seduced by a stranger in the neigh- bouring town, and she has even given birth to a living witness of her frailty, after which event she has been abandoned by her lover, and is now come back to her native vil¬ lage. The schoolmaster of the village is her good friend, and she requests him to inform her father of what she has done; a very unnecessary communication, as it seems, since her paramour and his child have both disappeared, and nobody need know any thing of the adventure. The old hunter however learns it, and is nearly distracted with rage ; he seizes a gun, levels it at his daughter, and is on the point of shooting her. The schoolmaster saves her life for the moment; but, as her father gives her the moment; but, as her father gives her his malediction in the most tragical terms, she leaves him with the intention of putting a period to her existence.—Pretty well this for a farce! Hereupon the seducer arrives with an order for the delivery of a house which he has bought in the neighbourhood, the keys of which are in the hands of the keys of which are in the hands of                            "

His mistake is, of course, eventually cleared up, and, of course too, their marrage and the father's pardon close this strange farce, in which the only comick character is that of the schoolmaster. But as it is a play in one act, they call it a farce; as they would, if it were in one act. call even the Stranger,—which is the real model of all these beastly and vulgar farces.

The exceptions, however, are numerous enough to prevent me from describing them as a positively ugly race.

It certainly deserves its great repu¬ tation ; but we could only see it very imper¬ fectly and from above, owing to our being accompanied by a stupid Cicerone, whose assistance we had not desired.

WhenI told him that I longed to see a new work of his composition, he said that he hoped I should not take that upon which he was engaged as a standard of his powers, for it certainly would be the worst of his operas ; the Romans, he said, liked nothing but— (here he sung a few bars of trivial musick)—and he must serve them to their taste, in order to be as gently hissed as possible.

He told me that Tan¬ credi, and The Italian in Algiers, were mere trifles, which he had composed in six weeks; and he requested me not to judge him till I had heard Othello and Elizabeth, one of which had cost him six, and the other nine months' labour. This circumstance, I will own, did not give me a more favourable idea of those two operas. In composition, I look upon la prima intenzione as a most in¬ dispensable quality. An opera must bear the appearance of having been made at one dash, in a moment of inspiration; nothing else can give it that smoothness of general effect, which is like the mellowness of co¬ louring in a fine picture. From the over¬ ture to the finale, there must be nothing that may make one start, as at the sudden appearance of an unknown and unwelcome stranger in an intimate family circle.

This the very type which I the rest. This the very type which I would recommend for a good opera. When Ispeak of composing an opera in a moment of inspiration, I would not be a moment of inspiration, I would not be understood to mean literally a moment in point of time; the duration of this moment may be indefinite; but then the mind must have been so warmed and exalted by the first conception, that nothing may have the power to divert or interrupt the composer. till he has completed his work ; and I be¬ liève that one who is able to achieve a de¬ lightful opera in six weeks, cannot improve it by spending years upon it.

There are small windows, as if for entresols, which are positively absurd in the front of a temple, where no entresols exist; nor do the large ones produce a much better ef¬ fect, as they are without glass and give the idea of an unfinished building. As to the colonnade, which forms a sort of broken circle in the place below, I do not hesi¬ tate to pronounce it the worst part of the whole. The proper use of such a struc ture is to screen people from the sun, or from the rain ; but here it cannot answer the purpose, since you are obliged to en¬ dure almost as much sun or rain, ere you can reach either side of it, as if you went straight up to the church,—which indeed most people do. If, on the other hand, it be meant for a covered promenade, it does not much matter what shape is given to it; though the circular is, in my opinion, the worst of all shapes, since it necessarily admits wind and rain into one part of it at least: but, in fact, nobody ever thinks                            "

But with all this, it is so far from being comfortable as a residence, that the Pope’s officers complain bitterly of their lodgings in it. Captain Pfyffer, the commander of his Swiss Guards, told me, that he had begged and obtained leave never to accompany the l'ope to the Vati¬ çan, but to remain at the Quirinal. Be¬ sides, the air is in summer extremely un¬ wholesome in this part of the town, and nobody could bear to reside in it for a continuance. The Pope only inhabits it during part of the winter. It was formerly a subject of much dispute where he ought always to reside: some pretended that he should not move from the Vatican;—but these were probably young Cardinals, who wished all their elder brethren safe out of this wicked world. Others asserted that religion made it an indispensable duty to prefer San Giovanni Laterano, at the furthest end of the town in a complete desert ;                            "

But this interesting dis¬ cussion has been abandoned ; and the Pope is now allowed to live where he pleases, which is more frequently in the country than in the town. The access to the Palace of the Vatican has nothing majestic in it. Though it is built on higher ground than St. Peter's, to which it adjoins, and which it towers above, which it adjoins, and which it towers above, yet the only effect of this elevation is to in¬ terfere with and spoil the appearance of the church. The principal ascent to it is by a grand staircase, one side of whose first flights is formed by the northern or north-north-eastern wall of the church; but there are several other entrances. In architecture the Vatican has no preten¬ sions whatsoever to elegance, beauty, or regularity. There were too many very                            "

In short, there is nothing to praise in the general outward appearance of the Vatican. As to the inside, there is undoubtedly in that vast labyrinth, food for criticism to the end of time. But as longas it shall contain the noble ornaments which it owes to Grecian and to Roman art, no other palace in the world, (though built by fairies, of solid gold, with bricks of ruby, and windows of sapphire) will be able to vie with it for the pre-eminence.

On the other hand, it would likewise be most desirable to bring to the Museum of the Vatican the finest of the statues kept the Vatican the finest of the statues kept in the Capitoline Museum, such as the in the Capitoline Museum, such as the real Antinoùs, the Dying Gladiator, the Faun, and the beautiful Venus; all which, with the statues of the Belvedere, would furnish out the most glorious, collec¬ tion in the world.

Canova is the cleverest artist in Rome, and deserves all the encouragement which he has received; but he is far, very far, from that perfection to which his flatterers persuade him he has attained.

The Virgin Mary and Joseph are just come in, in search of Jesus; and the former seems to say, that she has been looking for him every where, but without the least intention of conveying a tacit re¬ proach in this observation. There is a sweet expression of motherly pride in her countenance. This picture, on the whole, afforded me infinite delight; though the Virgin’s countenance might have been more dignified ; the head of one of the doctors is moreover a little too large. Another beautiful painting of Mr. Lanti's is his Antigone, at the moment that Creon is his Antigone, at the moment that Creon has ordered his guards to seize her.

The subject is a noble one, and is executed in a masterly manner. Mr. Lanti excels in females; and the less his figures are covered, the more the less his figures are covered, the more talent does he display in the representation of them. He showed us two other paint- ings of females, which I thought exquisitely beautiful ; the first represents a Young Bride, to whom her mother is introducing a husband : the other is Antiope, whom a husband : the other is Antiope, whom Love discovers sleeping to Jupiter, under the form of a Satyr. The latter has the colour of his disguise, and two small horns, but he has not the cloven feet, which Mr. Lanti considers as too much below the dignity of a God. The child is really charming, and would have done honour to the greâtest painter known.                            "

But in the latter I think he extends the poetical license a little too far,—omitting such buildings as would spoil the general effect of his pic- tures, completing others which are only imperfectly seen from the place whence he takes the view, introducing trees where no trees grow, and displacing those which partly conceal any object worthy of his pencil.

Nothing can be more correct, than the drawing and painting, (provided the enormous limbs of the exorcised child can be reasonably ac¬ counted for by the effect of the disorder that overpowers him); but the general effect of the picture did not appear to me to be very poetical, and though Thave seen it se¬ veral times since, it never struck me as being                            "

The next painting in point of reputation, is Domenichino's last Communion of St. Jerome. If 1 had not seen it, I never should have been able to conceive that an old man, painted naked, in the last stage of decrepi¬ tude, with all his wrinkles, could produce any other effect than that of disgust or pity.

Viewing those monuments with the deepest interest myself, I had no room for the consideration of how I might best convey the impression of that interest to others. But I shall make my account of them as clear, and as little deficient in essential points, as I can. Modern Rome extends over a very con¬ siderable part of the ancient capital of the empire,—though not over the most inte¬ resting part of it, with the exception only of the immediate vicinity of the Ca¬ pitol. Several of the hills are now com¬ pletely abandoned, or are inhabited only by gardeners, peasants, and a few pro¬ prietors of villas. This the real cause of the strange disappearance of pôpulation in the outskirts and neighbourhood of Rome. The husbandmen and country¬ people left their villages or hamlets, where numerous banditti kept them in constant fear and real danger, and retired within the walls, where they found more ground to cultivate than they had really occasion for. These are the people who supply the mar- kets; and little is wanted beyond what they                           "

This instance is sufficient to convey a notion of the rest; and whoever has given the subject a moment's thought, needs not be astonished to see the country around so completely deserted. In a walk which I took one beautiful day, with Mr. Edward Bankes, we went out of the Porta Appia, (now called Porta di San Sebastiano) round the walls, and in again at the Porta di S. the walls, and in again at the Porta di S. Giovanni Laterano, without having met with any living creature save one man and some hogs he was driving, though the distance was at least a mile and a half. It appeared expedient to begin with this obvious reflection (which I do not recol¬ lect to have heard mentioned before) be¬ cause it affords, I think, a very sufficient answer to the ever-renewing lamentations, in which so many writers indulge on this in which so many writers indulge on this subject.

I shall first observe, that this carelessness about old buildings, even about those which were most respected, was a striking feature of the Republick of Rome. Livy says, that the temple of Jupiter Feretrius was fallen to pieces through old age—vetustate dilapsum— when Augustus rebuilt it; and Cornelius Nepos, in the life of Atticus, assigns an additional reason for this dilapidation. namely, neglect,— vetustate atque incu¬ ria detecta ædes.\" Such witnesses as Livy and Cornelius Nepos, when they speak of their own times and of objects which of their own times and of objects which they saw with their own eyes, are as¬ suredly most unexceptionable. Here then we see, that those very Romans whose méanest edifices it is held to be “ a shame to abandon to decay, did not themselves to abandon to decay, did not themselves take care of their noblest and most vene¬ rable monuments and temples, for what could be more venerable in their eves than                            "

It is really too absurd to expect that a Christian bishop should take better care of the heathen temples, than the heathens themselves did. In the next place, we ought never to forget, that some of those noble edifices of ancient Rome had been completely in¬ undated with Christian blood. Several thousands of martyrs were torn to pièces by wild beasts in the Coliseum, which is without comparison the grandest of all the monuments still existing. The Coliseum, too, perpetuates the memory of other hor¬ rors committed by the conquering nation, for it was built by twelve thousand pri¬ soners of war reduced to slavery : they ac¬ complished the work in the space of five vears, a period within which nothing but the most cruel treatment could have com¬ pelled them to finish the task;—though the time may seem sufficient to those who never saw that giant-theatre, which contained places for more than one hun¬                            "

I should have thought that it had been well for the honour of the ancient Romans, if this monument of barbarous turpitude had been levelled with the ground; but I frequently met with Eng¬ lish travellers gravely asserting, that the Popes deserved the curses of mankind for having permitted a few altars to be raised, and a cross to be erected, in the Arena!—where, by-the-bye, they do not in the least interfere with the amphi¬ in the least interfere with the amphi¬ theatre, and are even intended to protect it against new depredations.

The ruins of Rome would afford the most delightful entertainment to a person well versed in the poetry and the prose of its ancient authors, if the places which those authors mention had retained their origi¬ nal names, and could be known again with any degree of certainty. But this very far from being the case. A great many of the ancient streets have lost every trace of their former appellations, and are only known by the name of some Saint. This circumstance is certainly very provoking. But the same thing happens in every country that has experienced great changes; and those who approved of the proceed¬ ings of the French in giving revolutionary names to the streets and bridges of Paris, ought not to be so very severe with the Popes or the Romans, for having done the same at Rome.

IF we were to judge of the state of so- ciety in Rome under the kingly power, from the Tales which so many writers have dignified with the title of Roman History, we should find it very difficult indeed to account for the astonishing mag¬ nificence of its earliest monuments. The Cloaca Maxima, built by the elder Tarquin, is I believe the most stupendous work known in Europe,—a work which even Egyptian kings might have admired. The Curia Hostilia offers remains of similar architecture: walls and vaults, built with stones of such enormous size, and so closely joined, that they are likely enough to en- dure to the end of the world.

I shall adhere to my promise of abstaining from a long disser¬ tation this subject, but I must be per¬ mitted to lay before my readers a single page or two devoted to an investigation upon which I wrote more than fifty on the spot. There is a passage in Tacitus which solved my doubts, and which I think will appear equally conclusive to those who ex¬ amine it with the same attention that I did.

So that this first side, that of the Fo¬ rum Boarium cannot be doubted to have been in that line which stretches from the Capitol towards the Arch of- Janus Quadri- frons and the Tiber,—between the modern town on the right, and the Mount Palatine on the left. The second line is more on the left. The second line is more clearly indicated by the words, “ Per ima « Montis Palatini ad aram Consi.\" The Ara Consi we know to have been in the Circus Maximus, between the Palatine and Aventine Hills.

The Capitol is so very different from what it was in ancient times, that it affords but little satisfaction at first sight ; it is however, far from being so insignificant as some would have it, and it grows more in¬ teresting on a nearer examination.

The Intermontium is lower still, but much higher than it seems.

They were feared and shunned by the natives, who would not consent to form alliances with them: they were conse¬ quently obliged to take wives by force, which is a proof that they had brought none with them. 3. They experienced numerous and great difficulties in forming their settlement; they had to carry on several wars, or at least to fight several battles with their neighbours ; whom they overpowered, by opposing the personal strength and military skill of warriors, to the undisciplined numbers of shepherds unused to arms. 4.

If I were to yield to the temptation of pushing the argument as far as it would go, I might add that some remains of Cyclopian walls must have been observable at Rome, if the city had been sounded by Italians.

I had then lost a help which would have been likely to shorten my labour very considerably. An intimate friend whose classical taste and ardent application to study, eminently qualified him to assist to study, eminently qualified him to assist me in such an investigation, had lately left Amsterdam, where his society had made the charm of my life, and his conversation the delight of all my leisure hours. It was impossible to know him without growing better—by his example rather than by his advice: and though I did not profit by either as I ought to have done, he had so far succeeded in my reform, as to make me capable of perseverance in what I under¬ took, as well as more scrupulous in the choice of my pursuits. He had the art of turning me, without any apparent effort or exhortation his part, from the unpro¬ fitable desultory discussions in which it was too much my habit to indulge, and of unconsciously exciting a fondness for use¬ ful investigations.

Deprived of his assistance, my struggle with the difficulty was much longer and more laborious than I should otherwise have found it. At last, as by a flash of light, my attention was suddenly turned to etymologies. I was surprised to find that whenever the Roman writers attempted to give the etymology of the name of any one of their earliest institutions, the mostsensible and acute of them grew perfectly absurd. They said, for instance, that Romulus had but a very inconsiderable number of com¬ panions, young adventurers like himself, in the formation of his settlement; and yet they traced the etymology of his Senators from Senex, an old man ! They said that the Consualia were games in honour of Neptunus Equestris ; and yet they derived the word from Consus, a supposed god of Counsel!—That in the Lupercalia, a goat was sacrificed, and also a dog; and                            "

We are told thatthelatter established themselves in Mysia in the fourth or fifth century of the Christian era, but Nestor may have been deceived by two narrations, or traditions, which coincided in some points; and he may have blended them into one. It is highly probable that the Sclavonians inhabited Mysia in the most ancient times, and that some national disaster forced them to abandon that country ; that the greatest number emigrated by land, but that a part of them embarked on the Ægean Sea, and were tossed about till they arrived on the Latin shore. It may be observed, that Mysia was so very near Troy, that this famous town was very possibly the real spot from which they started after its siege.

The poem began with a most extraordinary simile—“ In like man- “ <space> n e r <space> a s <space> N e b u c h a d n e z a r <space> b e n t <space> h i s <space> b o d y <space> “ ner as Nebuchadnezar bent his body “ over a brook, to look into it,—so did * Gessler require that people should bow * to his hat.\" The likeness between the two members of this comparison it will be admitted, is not very obvious.

When the part is ill performed, it seems intoler¬ able stuff ; but in the hands of a good actor, it is extremely entertaining. None but Italians, however, can be so passionately fond of it as to be pleased with Pulcinello's acting a part in serious dramas or the deepest tragedies. The theatre of Pallacorda is just of the same form as the theatre Della Pace, but much smaller, having only two rows of boxes. Its passages are abominable, being exceedingly narrow and low ; and the stair¬ case is a mere assemblage of broken planks.

The wretched family to which she belonged had been five whole days without a mouthful of bread, and for the last three days without even the cabbage-leaves and stalks, which they used to pick up in the streets or on the dunghills, and which it seems other more vigilant paupers had taken away.
