From the¬ ancient artists having exercised their genius in forming the images of an order of beings superior to mankind, anot er and a greater advantage is supposed to¬ have followed; it prompted the artists to attempt the uniting, in one form, the various beauties and excellencies which nature had dispersed in many.

It therefore required or a different shape. It therefore required great judgment and taste to collect those various graces, and combine them with elegance and truth; and repeated efforts of this kind are imagined to have inspired some of the ancient sculptors with sublimer ideas of beauty than nature herself: ever exhibited, "

Though the works of no modern artist can stand a comparison with the great master-pieces now alluded to, yet nothing can be more absurd than the idea which some people entertain, that ali antique statues are of more excellent work¬ manship than the modern. We see, every day, numberless specimens of every species of sculpture, from the largest statues and basso-relievos, to the smallest cameos and intaglios, that are undoubtedly antique, and vet far inferior, not only to the works of the best artists of Leo the Tenthis time, but the best artists of Leo the Tenthis time, but also to those of many artists now alive in various parts of Europe.

We must have a very high idea of the number of statues, ofone kindor of the number of statues, ofone kindor other, which were in old Rome, when we consider, how many are still to be seen; how many have at different periods been carried away, by the curious, to every country in Europe; how many were mu¬ tilated and destroyed by the Gothic bruta¬ lity "

This obliged the wretched heathens to hide the statues of their gods and of their ancestors in the bowels of the carth, where unquestionably great numbers of them still remain. Had they not been thus barbarously hewed to pieces, and bu¬ ried, I had almost said, alive, we might have had several equal to the great master¬ pieces in the Vatican; for it is natural to imagine, that the rage of the zealots would be chiefly directed against those statues which were in the highest estima¬ tion with the heathens; and we must like¬ wise imagine, that these would be the pieces which they, on their part, would endeavour, by every possible means, to pre¬ serve from their power, and bury in the carth.

Finally, the lady declared, she was convinced this statue could not be a just representation of¬ Hercules; for it was not in the nature of things, that a man so formed could ever have been a reliever of distressed dam¬ sels. Without such powerful support as that of the fair sex, I should not have exposed myself to the resentment of connoisseurs, by any expression which they might con¬ strue an attack upon this favourite statue; but, with their support, I will venture to assert, that the Farnese Hercules is faulty both in his form and attitude: the former is too unwieldy for active exertion, and the latter exhibits vigour exhausted. A resting attitude is surely not the most proper in which the all- conquering god of strength could be represented. Rest im¬ plies fatigue, and fatigue strength ex¬ hausted.

The ancient artist has erred, not only in giving him an attitude which supposes in giving him an attitude which supposes his strength wants recruiting, but in the nature of the strength itself, the character of which should not be passive, but active. Near to Hercules, under the arcades of the same Palezzo Farnese, is a most beau¬ tiful statue of Flora. The great advantage which ancient artists had in attending the exercises of the gymnasia, has been re¬ peatedly urged as the reason of their supe¬ riority over the moderns in sculpture. We are told, that belides the usual exercises of the gymnasia, all those who proposed to contend at the Olympic games, were obliged, by the regulations, to prepare them¬ selves, by exercising publicly for a year at Elis; and the statuaries and painters at Elis; and the statuaries and painters constantly attended on the Arena, where they "

By a constant attendance at such a school, in¬ a constant attendance at such a school, in¬ dependent of any other circumstance, the artists are supposed to have acquired a more animated, true, and graceful style, than possibly can be caught from viewing the tame mercenary models, which are exhi¬ bited in our academies. On the other hand, I have heard it asserted, that the artist, who formed the Farnesian Flora, could not have improved his work, or de¬ rived any of its excellencies, from the cir¬ cumstances above enumerated; because the figure is in a standing posture, and clothed.

But this reasoning is thought to consist. But this reasoning does not seem just; for the daily opportu¬ nities the ancient artists had of seeing naked figures, in every variety of action and attitude, must have given them advan¬ tages over the moderns, in forming even drapery figures. At Sparta, the women, upon particular occasions, danced naked. In their own families, they were seen every day clothed in light draperies; and so se¬ condary was every consideration, even that of decency, to art, that the prettiest vir¬ gins of Agrigentum, it is recorded, were called upon by the legillature, without dis¬ tinction, to shew themselves naked to a painter, to enable him to paint a Venus. Whilst the moderns, therefore, must ac¬ knowledge their inferiority to the ancients in the art of sculpture, they may be allow¬ ed 9 "

In these the Greek artists display an unquestion¬ able superiority over the most successful efforts of the moderns. For me to at¬ tempt a description of these master-pieces, which have been described a thousand times and imitated as often, without once having had justice done them, would be equally vain and superfluous. I confine myself to a very few observations. The most insensible of mankind must be struck with horror at sight of the Laocoon. On one of my visits to the Vatican, I was ac¬ companied by two persons, who had never been there before: one of them is accused of being perfectly callous to every thing which does not immediately touch his own person; the other is a worthy, good man: the first, after staring for some time with marks "

An accident of that kind happening to the lungs, is more dangerous and difficult to cure, than when the same takes place in most other parts of the body; because the lungs are vital organs, essentially ne¬ cessary to lise, and when their motion is impaired, other animal functions are thereby injured; because they are of an uncommonly delicate texture, in which a rupture having once taken place, will a rupture having once taken place, will be apt to increase; because they are in con¬ be apt to increase; because they are in con¬ stant motion and exposed to the access of external air, both of which circumstances are unfavourable to the healing of wounds; and "

The pleurisy, or inflammation of the lungs, is a disease more frequent in cold countries than in mild; in the spring than in the other seasons; and more apt to seize people of a sanguine constitution than others. Plentiful and repeated bleedings, foment¬ ations, blisters near the affected part, and a cooling, diluting regimen, generally re¬ a cooling, diluting regimen, generally re¬ move it, without its leaving any bad con¬ sequence.

Those who have a predisposition to this complaint, by their form, are most apt to be attacked after their full growth; women from fifteen to three-and-thirty; men two or three years later. In Great Britain, a spitting of blood generally occurs to those predisposed to it, in the spring, or beginning of sum¬ mer, when the weather suddenly changes from cold to excessive hot; and when the heat is supposed to rarify the blood, before the solids are proportionably relaxed from the contracted state they acquire during the cold of winter.

Violent exercise may occasion the rup¬ ture of blood-vessels in the lungs, even in those who have no hereditary disposition to such an accident; it ought there¬ fore to be carefully avoided by all who have. Violent exercise, in the spring, is more dangerous than in other seasons; and, when taken at the top of high moun¬ tains, by those who do not usually reside there, it has been considered as more dan¬ gerous than in vallies. The sudden dimi¬ nution of the weight of the atmosphere, co-operating with the exercise, renders the vessels more apt to break. Of all things the most pernicious to people pre¬ disposed to a spitting of blood, is, plaving upon wind-instruments.

Mercury, which has been found so powerful in disposing other ulcers to heal, has no good effect on ulcers of that organ;–though some physicians imagine it may be of service in the beginning, to dissolve "

Various kinds of gums, with the natu¬ ral and artificial balsams, were long sup¬ posed to promote the healing of external wounds and ulcers, and on that account were made the basis of a vast variety of ointments and plasters. It was af¬ terwards imagined, that the same re¬ medies, administered internally, would have the same effect on internal ulcers; and of course many of those gums and balsams were prescribed in various forms for the pulmonary consumption. The reasoning on which this practice was established, however, seems a little shal¬ low, and is far from being conclusive; for although it were granted that these balsams contributed to the cure of wounds, when applied directly to the part, it does not "

After it is fully established that myrrh is of use in such instances, it will still be worthy of investigation, whether it is of more or less than Jesuits bark.

This method has been often tried; but I fear the success with which it has been attended, gives no encou¬ ragement to continue the practice. That symptoms may be such, in every period of this disease, as to require this evacuation, this disease, as to require this evacuation, is not to be denied; but there is a great is not to be denied; but there is a great difference in the application of what is con¬ sidered as an occasional palliative, and that from which we expect a radical cure.

N the first Sunday of May, we had C an opportunity of seeing the famous Neapolitan miracle, of the liquefaction of Saint Januarius blood performed. This Saint, you know, is the patron of Naples; which circumstance alone forms a strong presumption of his being a Saint of very considerable power and efficacy; for it is not to be imagined that the care of a city, like Naples, which is threatened every moment with destruction from Mount Vesuvius, would be entrusted to an under¬ strapper. Indeed there has, on some occa¬ sions, been reason to fear, that, great and powerful as this Saint is, the Daemon of the mountain would have got the better of him; however, as Saint Januarius has been able to protect them hitherto, and is sup¬ T 2 posed "

Saint Januarius suffered martyrdom about the end of the third century. When he the end of the third century. When he was beheaded, a pious lady of this city caught about an ounce of his blood, which has been carefully preserved in a bottle ever since, without having lost a single grain of its weight. This of itself, were it equally its weight. This of itself, were it equally demonstrable, might be considered as a greater miracle than the circumstance on which the Neapolitans lay the whole stress, viz. that the blood which has congealed, and acquired a solid form by age, is no sooner brought near the head of the Saint, than, as a mark of veneration, it immedi¬ ately liquefies. This experiment is made three different times every year, and is considered "

As the divinity of no other religion whatever is any longer attempted to be proved by fresh miracles, but all are now trustèd to their own internal evidence, and to those wrought at a former period, this miracle of Saint Januarius is probably the more admired on account of its being the only one, except transubstantiation, which remains still in use, out of the vast abun¬ dance said to have been performed at vari¬ ous periods in support of the Roman Ca¬ tholic faith. The latter is unquestionably the greater miracle of the two; for to change the greater miracle of the two; for to change a wafer into flesh and blood, is more extra¬ a wafer into flesh and blood, is more extra¬ ordinary than to liquefy any substance what¬ ever: Yet I once imagined the liquefaction had rather the advantage in this particular; that the change is more obvious to the senses.

A zealous believer of this country, having described the miracle, breaks out into the following exclamations: “ O illustre “ memoria!

The real head is probably not so fresh, and well pre¬ served, as the blood; and on that account is not exposed to the eyes of the public, but inclosed in a large silver bust, gilt and en¬ riched with jewels of high value. This being what appears to the people, their idea of the Saints features and complexion are taken entirely from the bust. The blood is kept in a small repository by itself. About mid-day, the bust, inclosing the real head, was brought with great solem¬ nity, and placed under a kind of portico, open on all sides, that the different com¬ munities, which come in procession, may be able to traverse it, and that the people may have the comfort of beholding the miracle. The processions of that solemn day were innumerable; all the streets of Naples were crowded with the various orders of ecclesi¬ astics, dressed in their richest robes.

But as there are a great many convents in Naples, and a great number of monks in each convent, though the processions be¬ gan soon after mid-day, the evening was well advanced before the last of them had passed.

In those prayers he was joined by the multitude around, particularly by the women: of whom there seemed more than their proportion.

Twenty minutes had already elapsed, since the Archbishop had been pray¬ ing with all possible earnestness, and turn¬ ing the phial around and around without any effect. An old monk stood near the archbishop, and was at the utmost pains to instruct him how to handle, chase, and rub the phial; he frequently took it into his own hands, but his manoeuvres were as ineffectual as those of the archbishop. By this time the people had become exceedingly noisy; the women were quite hoarse with praying; the monk continued his opera¬ tions with increased zeal; and the arch¬ bishop was all over in a profuse sweat with vexation.

Some of these illands are twelve or fifteen yards in length; the soil is suffi¬ ciently strong to bear five or six people, who, by the means of a pole, may move to different parts of the lake, as if they were in a boat. This lake empties itself by a whitish, muddy stream, into the Te¬ verone, the ancient Anio; a vapour, of a sulphureous smell, arising from it as it flows.

His Bacchus and Faunus, of which the well-known story is told, have been by some preferred to the two antique figures representing the same.

Nor do I think he would choose to represent him moaning or lan¬ guishing with pain or sickness; there is nothing heroic in that; nor do we sympa¬ thise so readily with the pains of the body, as with those of the mind. As for the story of his weeping for new worlds, he will excite still less sympathy, if that is the cause of his affliction. The last conjec¬ ture, therefore, that the artist intended to represent him in a violent fit of remorse, is the most probable. The unfinished bust of Marcus Brutus, by Michael Angelo, ad¬ mirably expresses the determined firmness of character which belonged to that virtu¬ ous Roman. The artist, while he wrought at this, seems to have had in his mind Ho¬ race S Ode, Justum et tenacem propositi virum Non civium ardor prava jubentium, Non vultus instantis tyranni Mente quatit solidâ, &c.

In a former letter, I gave my reasons for prefering the plan of education at the public schools of England, to any other now in use at home or abroad. After the young person has acquired the fundamen¬ tal parts of learning, which are taught at schools, he will naturally be removed to some university. One of the most elegant and most ingenious writers of the present age has, in his Inquiry into the Causes of the Wealth of Nations, pointed out many deficiencies in those seminaries. What that gentleman has said on this subject, may possibly have some effect in bringing about an improvement. But with all their de¬ ficiencies, it must be acknowledged, that no universities have produced a greater number of men distinguished for polite li¬ terature, and eminent for science, than those of England. If a young man has previously acquired the habit of applica¬ tion, "

But whatever plan is adopted, whether the young man studies at the uni¬ versity, or at home with private teachers, while he is studying with diligence and alacrity, it would be doing him a most essential injury, to interrupt him by a pre¬ mature expedition to the Continent, from an idea of his acquiring the graces, ele¬ gance of manner, or any of the accomplish¬ ments which travelling is supposed to give. Literature is preferable to all other accom¬ plishments, and the men of rank who pos¬ sess it, have a superiority over those who do not, let their graces be what they may, which the latter feel and envy, while they affect to despise. According to this plan, a youth pro¬ perly educated, will seldom begin his fo¬ reign tour before the age of twenty; if it "

This the age, it may be said, when young men of fortune endeavour to get into Parliament: itis so; but ifthey should remain out of Parliament till they are a sew years older, the affairs of the nation might possibly go on as well. It may also be said, if the tour is defer¬ red till the age of twenty, the youth will not, after that period of lise, attan the modern languages in perfection. Nor will he acquire that easy manner, and fine ad¬ dress, which are only caught by an early ac¬ quaintance with courts, and the assemblies of the gay and elegant. This true to a certain degree; but the ansver is, that, by remaining at home, and applying to the pursuits of literature, he will make more valuable attainments. Iam at a loss what to say about those same graces; it is certainly desirable to possess "

They sometimes appear as volun¬ teers, but cannot be pressed into any ser¬ vice; and those who shew the greatest anxiety about them, are the least likely to attain them. I should be cautious, there¬ fore, of advising a young man to study them either at home or abroad with much solicitude. Students of the graces are, gene¬ rally, the most abominable affected fellows in the world. Thave seen one of them make a whole company squeamish. a whole company squeamish. Though the pert familiarity of French children would not become an English boy, vet it merits the earliest and the utmost attention to prevent or conquer that awk¬ ward timidity which so often oppresses the latter when he comes into company. The timidity I speak of, is entirely different from modesty.

Among their companions or inferiors, they were saucy, rude, and boisterous. If boys of this description only were liable to bashfulness, it would be a pity to remove it. But although this quality is distinct from modesty, it is not incompatible withit. Boys of the most modest and most amiable disposition are often overwhelmed with it; from them it ought to be removed, if it can be done, without endangering that modesty which is so great an ornament to youth, and indeed to every period of life¬ This, surely, may be done in England, as well as in any other country; but itis too much neglected: many consider it as a matter of no importance, or that it will wear off by time.

To attain betimes, that ease and ele¬ gance of manner, which travelling is sup¬ posed to bestow, and that the young gen¬ tleman may become perfectly master of the modern languages, some have thought of mixing the two plans; and, instead of alloving him to prosecute his studies at home, sending him abroad, immediately on his coming from school, on the sup¬ on his coming from school, on the sup¬ position that, with the assistance of a tutor and foreign professors, he will proceed in the study of philosophy, and other branches the study of philosophy, and other branches of literature, during the three or four vears which are employed in the usual tour.

But that such a taste will, for the first time, spring up in the breast of a the first time, spring up in the breast of a boy of fixteen or seventeen, amidst the dis¬ sipation of theatres, reviews, processions, balls, and assemblies, is, of all things, the least probable. Others, who think lightly of the import¬ ancè of what is usually called science to a young man of rank and fortune, still con¬ tend, that a knowledge of history, which they admit may be of some use even to men of fortune, can certainly be acquired during the years of travelling.
