            "AN ACCOUNT OF ITALV. CHAP. XVII. MR. Sharp has said, that the Italians place all their young ladies in convents, and leave them there until they marry or take the veil; and the same thing has been the veil; and the same thing has been repeatedly asserted by several protestant travellers* long before Mr. Sharp thought of giving the world his itinerary letters. But why do these folks take so much pains to circulate this falshood in their * See the first note to the preceding chapter: respective B VOL. II. "

            "I 2 respective countries? Is it ignorance, or is it malice? I will suppose that they mean nothing else, but to make their young country-women in love with their several reformations, which allow of no convents, and keep them as much as possible from taking the least turn towards popery. But if this their design, they must suffer themselves to be put upon a level with cur knavish or foolish friars, who tellus millions of lies of the heretics with the pious intention to make us ad¬ here closer to our present mode of belief. Whatever motive the protestant travel¬ writers may have for this disingenuity, T must take the liberty to tell those who believe them, that their assertions upon this head are false, and that we have no such general custom: and indeed it would be impossible to have it, unless we were to build thousands of new con¬ we were to build thousands of new con¬ vents throughout our land, as those we have at present are neither numerous nor large "

Of this impossibility one may presently be convinced, by casting an eye on the authentic List of the inbabitants of Tuscany given us by Mr. Sharp. It appears by that list, that the number of the nuns that list, that the number of the nuns throughout that state amounts to little more than nine thousand, and that the number of unmarried women and giris amounts to more than three hundred and ten thousand. Let us now suppose upon a very mo¬ derate calculation, that out of the three hundred and ten thousand, only thirty-six thousand are young giris who are able to pay for education. Upon this supposition cur nunneries contain four pensioners for every nun, in consequence of Mr. Sharpis assertion. Thus, for instance, a nunnery inhabited byone hundred nuns, contains be¬ side four hundred young ladies who are pen¬ sioners. But if Mr. Sharp had taken the trouble only to step to some of cur nun¬ B 2 neries, "
        ],
        [
            "I 4 neries, and asked after the numbers of their inhabitants, he would have found, that a nunnery which contains, for in¬ stance, one hundred nuns, far from con¬ taining four hundred voung ladies, gene¬ rally contains not a single one, and very seldom more than six or seven. This dis¬ covery, which was not difficult to make, would probably have kept him from set¬ ting upon paper so palpable an untruth. By this account, corroborated by Mr. Sharps list, it plainly appears, that in¬ stead of having full thirty-six thousand young ladies locked up in the nunneries of. Tuscany, we have scarcely six hundred, which bear but a very small proportion to near a million of people: and it cannot be reasonably supposed that the rest of the Italians are upon a worse fööting than the Tuscans in this particular. Yet the distance between truth and Mr. Sharp’s assertion will prove still greater, when we consider that the institutions of several amongst cur female religious orders forbid the "

See now, my good readers, what de¬ pendance you must have on the veracity of your travel-writers, though their ac¬ counts be constantly uniform, and con¬ stantly delivered in the most petulant strain of affirmation! They see nothing; examine nothing; but copy one another in a most shameless manner. If the number of our young ladies placed in nunneries has been most im¬ pudently exaggerated by those ingenuous gentlemen, the number of our nuns themselves has likewise been by them en¬ larged to such a degree, as to make every credulous reader shrink with horrour. And vet Mr. Sharps list proves with un¬ contestable evidence, that their proportion to the rest of the community is no more than one to a hundred. But still this number of our nuns in proportion to the rest of our community will be exclaimed against as too large, by those B 3 "

But pray, my dear politicians, where is the country, whose women can all be made lawful mothers? Is it England? I am afraid not; since in England there are at least five or six maidens in a hundred, who grow old in the utter impossibility of providing themselves with husbands; which Iam sure is not the case in Italy, where an old maiden in an object scarcely ever to be seen, thanks to our nunneries, which are the general receptacle of those amongst our giris, to whom fortune (per¬ mit me the use of this heathenish word) has denied either a portion, or a fine face, or both. Let any English traveller (who stays long enough in the country for opportunities "
        ],
        [
            "7 opportunities of information, and is in¬ quisitive enough to obtain them) inquire into the original condition of our nuns, and inspect a few of their faces at the same time; and I warrant he will find, that the greatest part of them in their maiden state were very poor, and that vety sew of them would have had in the world such powers of attraction as to stand a fair chance for husbands. Where then is the great harm of having them parcelled out into nunneries, and let them live there from the estates belonging to them, and from their manual labour? I grant, that some rich and handsome giris may sometimes be found within their walls. But in a world like ours, is it really possible to have every thing per¬ fectly right? It is enough if, in the gross, institutions which are found agreeable to the prejudices of a people, are not very detrimental to their welfare.

To prove the first part of my assertion cannot be in my power; therefore I give the reader full liberty to credit or not. But for the second I refer him to Mr. Sharp s book, where it is said that the Italians scarcely ever will have unmarried servants; contrary to the general custom of England, where to be unmarried is an indispensible requisite in servants of an indispensible requisite in servants of either sex. Besides the above exaggerations about cur nuns and our girls locked up in nun¬ neries, many protestant travel-writers have thought proper to affirm, that the Italians are so naturally cruel, as frequently to compel their unhappy daughters to take to compel their unhappy daughters to take the vell. But when we consult Mr. Sharp’s list, and compare the number of cur nuns with that of our unmarried wo¬ men and giris, the imposture will glar¬ ingly show itself. If this practice was common among us, how could the pro¬ portion "

However Tallow that the case will some¬ times happen, and that parents will force a poor daughter into a nunnery: but far a poor daughter into a nunnery: but far from being generally so cruel, the Italian parents are so generally indulgent, that by far the greatest part of them are very sorry when their giris take it into their simple heads to turn nuns. Far from clapping them forcibly, or even chearfully, into convents, they do every thing in their power to set their brains aright their power to set their brains aright whenever they discover them thus inclined. They ridicule or scold them as soon as they declare any such intention; and if ridiculing and scolding will not do, they take time to comply with their desire. They dress them as genteely as they can, and carry them to operas, balls, masqua¬ rades, public walks, and other such places where young men ogle, and bow, and whisper, and talk loud, and perform all other acts of gallantry. They are in fine permitted "

If no¬ thing will do, and girls stand it out stub¬ bornly, then parents must submit, and they are made nuns, as the influence of the moon, a disappointment in a first love, a desire of shifting the scene of lise, and a desire of shifting the scene of lise, and some other such latent causes, is then construed by holy people into an evident call from heaven. But still ve must take notice that they are not made nuns as soon as they enter the convent. They must undergo a state of probation, which is called il Noviziato. This state in some convents continues a whole year, and in some others three years. Should the giris alter their mind within that time, they are presently sent back to their own homes. But if the nuns like the proba¬ tioner, it is a hundred to one she escapes them not; for they will then wheedle and caress her at such a rate, as to make her steadily persist in her resolution. Few "

Yet, as I said, it vill sometimes happen that a girl is compelled by designed ill usage at home to save herself in a nunnery. Instances of that kind are rare and striking. They ex¬ cite indignation at the time, and serve as warnings afterwards. An adventure hap¬ pened in my time at Milan, which as long as it is remembered will deter our sew unnatural parente from treating their daughters in such a manner. The adven¬ ture was this. The father and mother of a young lady took it into their fancy to make a nun of her, whether she wöuld or not. With such an infernal scheme in their heads, it may easily be imagined, that they tried all arts of persuasion, and when these falled, that they had recourse to rougher means.

From expostulation and reproach she proceeded to curses and exe¬ crations; and this with a tone of voice so loud and full of rage, that the nuns could hear her very plain from without. They hastened to knock at the door, and beg¬ ged of her to pacify herself and open it. The father stood interdicted, and the mo¬ ther trembled: both had lost their powers of speech. My hand shakes as 1 write the conclusion of this horrible tale.

Having now given an idea of the num¬ ber of our Italian nuns, and of the young ladies intrusted to their care for education, Imust tell the reader, that he is likewise grossly missed by the travel-writers when they inform him, that our nunneries are all very amply endowed, and superfluously rich. This far from being true: there are scarcely twenty nunneries throughout Italy posse ssed of greater funds than what are necessary to maintain them. On the contrary, the greatest part of them are so slenderly provided, that their poor inhabi¬ tants would fare but very indifferently, if they did not endeavour to better their hard condition by means of their manual labour.

The lise they lead is certainly not luxurious, and nothing but an early habit could make it endurable. They all go to bed early at night, and rise betimes in the morning, as they are never allowed more than seven hours sleep. Some orders practise discipline or scourging, and some not. Those that practise it are the most numerous; and the business is done before they lay themselves to rest, in such a man¬ ner as to be heard by their sisters in the next cells. However the mother abbess excuses it whenever they request it of her. As soon as the morning appears, and in winter long before, they get up and go in winter long before, they get up and go to sing their prayers in the choir.

If they have any little pension from their families, as is generally the case, or if they are ingenious and laborious, they are enabled to procure themselves some chocolate and coffee; and theyare all very ambitious to have some provision of these two things, that they may regale them¬ selves and their visiters: nor can their relations "

At Venice only itis not so: nay, the partitions there are so very large, that the partitions there are so very large, that one may conveniently shake hands with them. But the largeness of the Venetian grates has ruined the reputation of the Venetian nuns. An English Iady, when she reads this account, will be ready to think, that these unhappy creatures, closely confined, praying much, scourging often, working hard, and eating little, must all be very puny, very unhealthy, and quite out of humour vith themselves and vith the world.

It has sometimes happened, that à young nun has been seduced from her nunnery, nun has been seduced from her nunnery, and her lover has found means to run away with her. But this happens very seldom, as their gates are well watched: besides that the attempt is dangerous, as a man would be imprisoned for lise, if not condemned to death, were he to be over¬ taken in the flight. Then the poor things are so accustomed to their own ways, and know so little of the world, that it is next to impossible to induce any of them to make her escape, even when they are most sincerely enamoured. They know if they run away, that they must go to Geneva or to some other heretical country; and their ideas of hereties are most fright¬ ful. It is scarcely possible to make them believe that heretics have just such eyes and noses as we have, and that they are and noses as we have, and that they are C 2 likè "

Most of the Ve¬ netian nuns know better; but in all other parts of Italy, especially in little towns, they are in general thus absurd. Though they are not very devout, vet each has some favourite saint or angel, to whom she recommends herself, her lover, her friends, and her affairs, which, as 1 her friends, and her affairs, which, as 1 said, go little farther than making and selling some trifles.

The patriarch told her he had just heard, that she minded her office so little as to permit some of the nuns to go out of the convent at night: the nuns to go out of the convent at night: that he was informed of one actually out, and to assure himself of the fact, was come to visit the cells himself; insisting at the same time on her retiring instantly to her own apartment, as he did not want her company in his short visit.

One is by saving numerous masses, for which, under the specious title of alms, they are paid about sixpence each throughout Italy: the other is, by sending their lay-brothers every day beg¬ ging about the street of their towns, and to the houses in the neighbouring coun¬ try.

At Venice many of the necessitous go to seek relief in its hospitals from the neighbouring parts of Germany; and al¬ most every week foundlings are brought there from the freeport of Trieste. Nor does the Venetian government think this importation grievous to their state; but receives them indistinctly: and at Rome there are several hospitals solely destined to strangers, each overseen and attended by people that understand their respective languages. The French, Spaniards, and Germans, as well as some Italians not sub¬ ject to the pope, have an hospital each, where they can respectively meet with still greater conveniencies than in those where every body is received indiscriminately.

Many are the funds, and some of them very considerable, whose produce is yearly shared into competent sums, and distributed under the name of portions to poor maidens when they are willing to marry, or desirous to take the veil. Many protestants, who have been in¬ formed of this species of charity, which is pretty general amongst us, have ridi¬ culed us most unmercifully for allovwing portions to those females who resolve to seclude themselves for ever from the world: and the witty Mr. Sharp, seeing the pope distribute two hundred and thirty portions to às many maidens, the greater part of whom were to get husbands if they could, and the remainder to dedicate themselves to à monastic lise, instead of suffering his good¬ nature to operate and giving due prasse to D so "

He would be ridiculous if he was to answer me in the affirmative, because the contrary may the affirmative, because the contrary may easily be observed in any country, and especially in his own, as I have already had occasion to remark. Why then should we be so narrow-minded, or rather so hard-hearted, as to deny our charity to those poor giris, who have no bride¬ grooms ready to take them to the altar whenever a little sum is ready to begin housekeeping? Why are we not to help those, who, either through a mistaken piety or impossibility of marrying, resolve to end their days in celibacy, rather within than without the walls of a monastery? But we give a double portion to those who turn nuns, and this, in Mr. Sharps opinion, "

Twenty or thirty crowns will easily provide a poor maiden a husband; but twenty or thirty crowns are not suffi¬ cient to defray the expence, if she has a mind to turn nun. Why therefore should she not be enabled by a larger sum to de¬ vote herself to that way of lise which she prefers to any other? Does Mr. Sharp think, that a double portion is an incite¬ ment to induce our poor girls to turn nuns rather than marry, supposing both in their option? If he really thinks so, T must advise him to study nature over again, and under some female preceptor too. Besides the funds thus applied in many parts of Italy to the marrying of poor maidens, or placing them in nunneries, we have some others in many places of a kind no less charitable. 1 mean those, that have been instituted to prevent the extortions of usurers, by which the dis¬ tresses of the poor are extremely aggra¬ vated in other countries.

Why do not all Christian nations adopt this Italian scheme of relieving their poor, ever sub¬ ject to the rapacious extortions of hard¬ hearted Jews or merciless pavnbrokers? I need not mention here that other kind of charity so common amongst the Italians, of giving alms to street- beggars.

With regard to the lov people, the Genoese are the most laborious and indus¬ trious that ever fell under my observation. Nor are they wanting in bravery; as the Germans have experienced to their cost in the last Italian war, when that army of theirs which had defeated forty or fifty thousand French at Piacenza, was by the Genoese populace impetuously attacked, routed, and put to a most ignominious flight. Trade in Genoa is far from being dero¬ gatory to nobility, as T have already ob¬ served: so that even the chief senators and members of government engage in it publicly, and in their own names.

The one is, that those republicans appear unvilling to Iose Corsica tamely; and such an unvilling ness in them is not reconcileable with the Grub-street notions of liberty and pro¬ perty.

Not only the generality of the Milanese nobles, but a great number of their gen¬ try and merchants, keep open tables, at which plenty and facetiousness preside. Mr. Sharp has observed, that the Nea¬ politans keep more coaches in proportion than even the English and the French. The same remark he might have made with regard to the Milanese, had he known any thing of their town: and their great number of coaches is not merely the effect of their love of pomp and show, as Mr. Sharp observes with his usual slyness, but the natural cousequence of the riches of both countries, both fer¬ of the riches of both countries, both fer¬ tile to a proverb.

I crave the¬ readers indulgence for endeavouring to give him some idea of both these games, just to make him sensible, that the Italians, who have often appeared great in the arts considered by mankind as great, are like¬ wise great in those that mankind will re¬ gard as little. Both the minchiate and the tarroceos consist of five suits instead of four, as common cards do. Four of those five suits ansver exactly to the four of the common cards, with only the addition of one card to the three that are figured in each suit; so that, instead of king, queen, and knave, we have king, queen, horse¬ man, and knave, both in the minchiate and the tarroccos.

By this account the reader will soon comprehend, that each of those games must necessarily be much superiour to whist and ombre, because of the greater number of combinations produced either by the ninety-seven cards of the minchiate, or the ninety-seven cards of the minchiate, or by the seventy-eight of tarrocco; which combinations cannot but give a larger scope to the imagination of the plaver than the lesser number arising from the forty of ombre, or the fifty-two of whist, and oblige him to exert his memory and  judgment "

Thave heard strangers, unable to com¬ prehend any of these our games, object both to the tarrocco’s and the minchiate, that they cannot be so diverting as the three mentioned, because they produce so many combinations as must prove too fatiguing. But if this argument carries conviction, we must of course conclude, that chess is less delightful than loo, be¬ cause it forces the mind to a greater recol¬ lection of its powers than loo. This reasoning is certainly just with regard to little and sluggish minds; but will not hold with respect to those that are lively and comprehensive. However, those Ita¬ lians, whose minds are much too con¬ tracted and disproportioned to the tarroc¬ cos and the minchiate, or those who do not chuse to exert thir talents too much, have still the means of diverting them¬ selves with several other games at cards that "

Let me add an observation more upon this subject. Many strangers are surprised that the Italians learn their games easily, and in a very little timè play at them with as much skill as the best players among as much skill as the best players among themselves. Hence they infer very kindly, that Italy abounds in gamblers more than their own respective countries. But tis this inference very logical?

A Roccolo is a circular spot of ground, generally on an eminence, and at some distance from any wood. This spot is planted with middle-sized trees in a circu¬ lar disposition. The diameter of the circle about thirty or forty feet. These trees, which must not be very bushy, are covered on one side with a net that is lest upon them as long as the sporting-time lasts. The area within the circle is likewise planted with trees much lower than the hedge round, and has in its center a green and bushy hut that contains many cages full of thrushes, finches, and such kind of small birds. A vard or two from those cages an owlis placed, that has been long used before-hand to eat his food perching on a fhort pole, the upper ex¬ tremity of which is formed into a kind of small culhion, stuffed with rags or straw.

The Roccolista, who knows what will be the consequence of the cry made by his little prisoners in the cages, stands ready with many short pieces of wood by his side, to fling them at the fly¬ ing birds.

The least noise in a Roccolo would make the birds keep at a great distance; therefore the Roccolista keeps there quite still and silent, only whistling from time to time through seve¬ ral tin-whistles hanging at his neck, by means of which he mimics with great exactness the chirping of several birds. All birds lie very still when they feel themselves entangled in a net, except the kite, who is often caught himself in a Roccolo when too eager in pursuing the small birds.

One, which I may possibly call peculiar to us, is that used on those of our lakes which abound with birds of the web-footed kind.

Many were the heads broken on such occasions, and scarcely a holiday passed without some boy or man being killed. However, this ancient custom was at last abolished in a great measure when this present king was married to his third wise; for it happened that the new queen, desirous of seeing the battajola, went with a great retinue to view it from the high wall of the gar¬ den 2 "

Many of my readers know very well what masses and benedictions are, or may easily know, either by asking their parson, or by only stepping into one of our popisi chapels here in London at the proper hours; therefore I shall spare myself the trouble of describing them: but going on with the thread of my story, I say that our churches, which are almost empty on working days, are generally full on holi¬ days, particularly in the morning. Every body has heard or read some¬ thing of the churches of Italy; how fine many of them are; and how pompously adorned. On holidays, and before break of day, their bells are in motion, and the lower kind of people then hasten to hear the mass. As every church has, at least, three altars, and our priests and friars are many, so there are in all churches as many 1 masses "

We have no pews in our churches; but only benches or chairs, that are fit both for kneeling and sitting. In those churches where there are only chairs, their servants or the sexton reaches one to any lady or gentleman. But in those churches where there are only benches, a lady hastens where "

A man on the approach of a woman, though but tolerably dressed, and no matter her age, presently rises off the bench, and gives up his place to her. She kneels for a moment; crosses herself; mumbles a short praver, (generally an ave maria); and if there is no mass ready at any of the altars, sits down till one be¬ gins. But if there is one just beginning, she continues kneeling until it is a little advanced; then sits; and kneels no more While it lasts, except when she hears the little bell that is rung when the priest elevates the host. Her kneeling at this timè is accompanied with an air of recol¬ lection, and a very humble attitude.

This last is an incitement not to be passed unnoticed, as the Italians never care for going to any place that is not visited by the sex. And our priests and friars know very well how to fill their churches with ladies by a benediction, giving them some piece of fine music, and contriving to have it when they return from their evening walk and haste to their supper, or conversaziones, or to the opera and the play. Priests and friars get something by thus filling a church, as they have always one or two fellovs, who go about the church collect¬ ing alms and presenting a bag fastened at ing alms and presenting a bag fastened at the end of a long pole to every body within the distance of it.

But Mr. Sharp is undoubtedly mistaken when he intimates that the Italians have an antipathy to the French, and when he an antipathy to the French, and when he adds that this antipathy has its source in their frequent and wanton invasions of Italy. Besides that the word wanton is ridicu¬ Iously emploved in his remark, as no na¬ tion is invaded merely through wanton¬ ness by another, there are sew states in Italy that have suffered much by what Mr. Sharp terms anvasions: nay some of those very states, where French armies have ap¬ peared in the tyo last wars, were in my opinion rather benefited than hurt by their appearance.
