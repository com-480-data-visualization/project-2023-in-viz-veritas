THE following sheets are offered to the Public with that anxiety of mind which must naturally arise from the pe- culiar situation of the individual, on whom the mournful task has devolved of arranging for the press the produc- tions of one who is no more ; an anxiety which, on the present occasion, instead of being lessened, is, perhaps, rendered only more acute, from the known high talents of the author. But, though the responsibility on this account be pro¬ portionally greater, yet, it may be hoped that his dis¬ tinguished abilities will give some weight to his obser¬ vations, even on subjects foreign to that line of science on which his celebrity is founded; and the unfinished state in which the manuscript was left at his decease, may perhaps be allowed to plead for that indulgence which might otherwise have been denied, or might not have been required.

He was aware of his own si¬ tuation ; but a singular degree of spirit, and ardour of character, prevented his ever betraying any conscious¬ ness of it.

He would often, in his earlier years, yield to the enjoyment they produced, and, wan- dering among the wild and grand scenery of his native land, indulge his imagination in gazing on the rapid stream, or watching the coming storm. Such habits seem to have tended, in some measure, to form his character; training him especially to independ- ence in judgment, and perseverance in investigation, that led him to seek knowledge, and boldly publish his opinions.

Judging of others by himself, he was too confiding in friendship, and too careless in matters of business ; consequently, from the one he was exposed to disappointment; and from the other involved in difficulties and embarrass¬ ments which tinged the colour of his whole life. On his arrival in Florence, he visited her far-famed gallery with that ardour of spirit which a subject of such interest naturally inspired:—Here he regularly and dally found himself surrounded by strangers, who with a flat- tering distinction, sought information from him, as from the first anatomist of the day. His correct knowledge of the human form giving the accuracy of science to his the human form giving the accuracy of science to his criticisms, they were valued as such by his countrymen, who seemed to expect, as a matter of course, that he would publish his remarks; insomuch, that several let¬ ters were written to England, proclaiming that he was engaged in the composition of a voluminous work, be¬ fore he had even formed the intention of proceeding be¬ vond the improvement of his own taste and ideas.

It was a beautiful morning. The air had been rendered peculiarly mellow and refreshing by a severe storm the preceding evening; and a bright sunshine cheered us on our way, shedding its pleasing influence on the mind, and dispelling that undefined dejection of spirit, which with such powerful influence affects us at the outset of a long journey.

The road from Paris by Fontainebleau to Lyons has been so often described, that I shall state only the ge- neral features of the country to be such, as to render the epithet of “ fair and fertile France\" well applied. The North and South of France are very different in appear- ance. The first, comparatively speaking, is vast and bleak; but, even at a short distance beyond Paris towards the South, the country becomes more pleasing and attract¬ ive. Trees of a larger growth, fine spreading oak, tall larches, pleasant valleys, and silvery rivers, vary the face of nature, and present a cheerful and luxuriant scene APPROACH TO LYONS. We reached the village of Macon, which is seated on the right bank of the river Saone, and, like Chalons, has the right bank of the river Saone, and, like Chalons, has its beauty confined to one view, early in the evening. The line of houses which forms the street; the quay, and the bridge, are handsome, as also the püblic walk which the bridge, are handsome, as also the püblic walk which                         "

Throughout France, in every little city, however inconsiderable, there is a in every little city, however inconsiderable, there is a shaded and well-sheltered public walk. This seems as indispensable as a café. These two lounging places are never empty, though they do not now perhaps present altogether the aspect they were wont to have. Formerly the French gaily danced away care, and laughed at po¬ verty ; but now, having become individually politicians, they are much more thoughtful and grave. The banks of the Saone, as the river widens after leaving Macon, become rich and beautiful, displaying an extended re¬ gion of wood and meadow ; while the eye, carried up the country, rests on the fresh green and varied forms the country, rests on the fresh green and varied forms of the sunny hills. On these hills grow the most pre¬ cious wines of France, while the country is beautiful, rich, and fertile in every kind of produce ; and still as we proceeded, new and pleasing views presented them¬ selves. On the opposite bank we beheld towns, castles, and convents rising in the distance ; sometimes, seated on the summit of a gentle elevation, lay spread out the on the summit of a gentle elevation, lay spread out the cheerful village, with its spires shining through the stately trees ; sometimes, with picturesque effect, the white dwellings of the farmer shewed themselves on the rising bank, overhanging the broad clear stream below.

The river, run¬ ning flat and still, opens wide as a lake, and seems to lie at the foot of this beautiful sloping hill. In this district I observed a peculiarity in the manner of building, from which its general appearance derives much beauty. Each gentleman’s seat, or farm-house, has a low running line of front, from some one point of which, in an irregular of front, from some one point of which, in an irregular form, rises a higher building, bearing somewhat the as- pect of a tower, and giving an antique cast to the dwell¬ ing; its lower parts are capt with that flat projecting roof, which everywhere strongly characterizes the archi¬ tecture of southern countries. Through all this tract of rich and fertile plains, the horizon is bounded by the distant mountains of Switzerland ; Savoy just opening to the eye like a long blue undulating line ; and occasion- ally the summit of Mont-Blanc may be discerned, min- gling its towering height with the clouds. As you as¬ cend Mont d’Or, every step of your progress is marked by new and striking objects ; and from its summit the prospect is most superb. To the west is seen all the wild and hilly country of Auvergne; to the south, the great chain of mountains, blue and splendid ; and to the north, the fine valley of the Saone, and the high grounds around the fine valley of the Saone, and the high grounds around Autun. This valley, in which the view of the river is                            "

At length, after a period of enjoyment and delight in surveying the surrounding scenery, we turned towards the valley below, and pro¬ ceeded to descend a precipitous hill. But yet no token of this great capital appears ; no smoke, no spires, no suburbs of clustering houses ; but splendid-built villas of white stone in the best style of architecture, with culti¬ vated fields, orchards, and gardens, adorn and enrich the slopes and hills. Another sweep of the river brings you upon the deep and rocky channel on which Lyons is seated, but still you see only a succession of villas of every varied and elegant form ; nor do you discover the city until you are actually on the level of the Saone. Few, I believe, conceive rightly the aspect of this singu- lar place, once the centre of the Roman dominions in the north, now the most celebrated for manufactures, and lately distinguished by revolutionary scenes which dis¬ graced human nature. The ancient city of this name, founded forty-two years before the Christian era, lay high on the face of the hills, as is attested in the present day by relics of every kind. In the year 145, it was in one night burnt to the ground; but shortly afterwards rebuilt by a grant from the Em- peror Nero.

On the bronze tablets found here are inscribed por¬ tions of the harangue of Claudius before he became Em¬ peror, imploring the Senate to grant to Lyons, his native city, the title of a Roman colony. Germanicus, Caracal¬ la, and Marcus Aurelius, were born here. The father of St Ambrose was Prefect in this city ; and the architect of the Tuilleries, Philip de l’Orme, as also the architect of the admired church of St Genevieve in Paris, was a of the admired church of St Genevieve in Paris, was a native of this place. The entrance into Lyons gives no impression of the importance of the city, or any intimation of its real gran¬ deur.

From the bridge you look back towards another great stone bridge, behind which rises a superb façade of an- tique houses, the whole presenting a coup-d'œil still more imposing than the view of the old bridge of Paris, closed by the towers of Notre Dame. This portion of the city is undistinguished by one fine mansion, and consists merely of streets of lofty buildings. which look well at a distance, but, on nearer inspection, are found to be only wretched neglected dwellings, the abodes of artificers, and of the poorest mechanics.

On entering a silk or gold-wire-drawing manufactory, I have found naked walls, patched windows, and wide empty rooms, containing for furniture nothing but the spinning¬ looms, an earthen pitcher, some broken plates, and crooked spoons, with a few loaves of bad bread. The inmates of these wretched places, were commonly an old woman, and a crowd of half-idle lads, lamenting the fall of Buonaparte and the close of the military system, which, of Buonaparte and the close of the military system, which,                            "

Much the finer portion of the city is that which lies beyond the Bridge. Here the great square opens; one side of it, adorned with trees, is low-built and ancient, and bears an antique cloistered aspect. The other is mo¬ dern, and much after the Parisian style;—very high, but with little ornament, and of simple architecture:—here are situated the Governor’s residence, the Post-Office, and other official houses ;—also two hotels for strangers, which we found, as we had been led to expect, very ex¬ pensive.

On this spot were massacred some of the wretched victims of the Revolution.

In crossing the bridge they were counted over, and being found to exceed the allot- ted number by two persons, the commanding officer, Vallot, was informed of the circumstance, and was asked. whether the two should be saved?' and in such a case which two? He replied, What matters it? who cares which two? He replied,  What matters it? who cares for two more or less? if they go to-day, they do not go to-morrow.' They proceeded, therefore, and two hun- dred and ten men, accompanied by these two ill-fated beings, whom accident had involved in the massacre, were conducted to death.

At the appointed signal, their limbs flew in every direc¬ tion. Those whose arms were shot away fell from the cable, and rose and fled, pursued by the cavalry, who cut them down. Those who were wounded, but yet not re- leased from the cable, cried out to their butchers to finish their work; and they did so without delay with the bay- onet and sabre. Their number was such as to render the work of butchery long and fatiguing; many were left breathing and palpitating in the agonies of death, and next morning many, still alive, were buried with the dead, by those who came out to pillage, and who threw lime upon them still quick and alive.\" Such is the narrative of a Frenchman.

The soldiers on guard, anxious to meet the inhabitants on their return, in their eagerness for the moment of release, sounded the retreat before the ap¬ pointed hour. The crowd forced its way onwards; two carriages on the bridge, one passing, and another return¬ ing, became entangled.

In this temple the Lyceum of Caligula was instituted, with the singular rule, that who- ever had the misfortune to produce a poor composition, should be condemned to the alternative of being thrown from the highest bridge into the river, or of expunging the work with his tongue. On the hill above the city, at a little distance from Porte St Trènée, are the remains of the aqueduct which brought water from the river Furan; a distance of seven miles. Near the village of St Foy and Chaponot, are to be seen still standing, several arches, curiously built, ac¬ cording to the manner of the Romans, with rubble of stone and mortar, and layers of brick. At a short dis¬ tance from this ruin stands a Convent of Ursulines, for¬ merly the site of baths, the remains of which are still very visible.

Within a mile or more of the highest summit of the mountain, a space, covered by a dull, sickly green, ex¬ pands into a plain, styled St Nicholas, where the lake of Mont Cenis lies, deep and dark. In the centre of this lake, we saw a little boat, with one man in it, rowing gently along. On the margin of the water are small low huts, of fifteen feet square, erected to shelter the travel¬ ler in the winter storm, when he might otherwise perish in the snows, or be driven by the furious eddying blasts in the snows, or be driven by the furious eddying blasts into the depths below. No foliage, or bush, or tuft, or twig, or even thistle, grows on this desolate spot. No¬ thing is seen, save these dreary dwellings, which in this season are uninhabited. On reaching the summit of Mont Cenis, we looked down on this plain, and on its broad flat lake, and little boat. The sun, shining over the mountain from behind, cast a deep shadow across its surface.

The first view of the inhabitants of this little city, gave us the impression of an amiable and gentle people. It was evening; and the citizens, priests, and soldiers, were sauntering through the dusty streets, in little friendly groups, looking upon the strangers, not with the stare of stupid curiosity, or the smile of self-complacency, but with a modest, kind, and benignant aspect; all ranks usually touching, or taking off their hats, in reply to the slightest symptom of courtesy.

Its frequent breaches over the fields, its wide-spread stony channel, its yellow waters, and roaring din, give it all the character of an Alpine stream, which, though pure at its source, becomes muddy here, from the clay of the mountains. At the narrowest point of the valley, it flows by a little fortress ; and we crossed it on a bridge de¬ fended by the fort. Here the stream bursts out into a broad and pebbly strand; and the prospect begins to wi¬ den, gradually spreading out into the grand valley of Piedmont, or of the Po.

Many of them are dis¬ tinguished by richness of ornament and good architec- ture. I was especially struck with the noble aspect of the Church of St John, situated immediately behind the palace; a flight of marble steps leads to the western front, which is very fine ; the entrance is wide, and the doorway richly ornamented with well-executed basso-re- lievos, and supported on each side by marble pilasters. On entering the church, the first object which invites attention, is a beautiful circular font of white marble, festooned in curious workmanship. At each side are finely ornamented chapels, and at the farther end of the church are planted the King’s seat, and the organ gal¬ lery, both very splendidly adorned : One of the chapels (that of St Michael) is truly superb, and well deserves a particular description. It stands high, like a gallery, above the level of the church, of which it forms a part, opening from its centre by a handsome flight of steps, and separated only by a fine marble balustrade, which, as well as two superb columns on either side, are of black as well as two superb columns on either side, are of black marble.

A sacrilegious soldier, ha¬ ving stolen the small silver vase with the consecrated wafer, from a church in Chamberry, proceeded as far as Turin, where, believing himself safe, he stopped with his mule ; but, to his utter amazement, the vase suddenly sprang up into the air, where it obstinately remained, till the Bishop Romagno, by a solemn procession, and fervent prayer, persuaded it to descend into a consecra¬ ted chalice. To commemorate this circumstance the church was built. Among the ancient works of art to be seen in Turin, there is a celebrated Egyptian table, which is shewn with much pride. It is composed of enamelled figures, partly lined with silver, on a dark copper-coloured ground ; and has once more found its way to Turin, after adventures probably as singular as those of any relic of Catholic times. It might be deemed little short of a mi¬ racle, that the soldiers, having begun to deface this pre¬ cious monument, by picking out the silver, were deterred from proceeding; but this was fully as natural as miracu¬ lous : for they found the plates of silver difficult to pull off, being extremely thin, and, in all the more delicate parts, little more than mere varnish of silver.

Including the suburbs and gardens, I am told Milan covers a space of ten miles. Some of the streets are wide. especially the main street, forming the centre of the city. although they are generally narrow ; but the effect pro- duced by the foliage of the fine trees, that relieve the eye in every direction, is very delightful. The Corso, or pub¬ lic walk, is beautiful, running along a space which opens to enchanting prospects in every direction. The impres¬ sions excited on entering Milan are very pleasing. In the evening or morning hours the shops are filled, the streets frequented, the corso covered by numbers of well¬ appointed carriages, and the whole presenting that busy, cheerful, crowded population, which gives the idea of a fine capital. Milan has no foreign trade; but the canals connecting it on one side with the Adda, and on the other with the it on one side with the Adda, and on the other with the Ticino, supply vast facilities and sources of interior com¬ merce.

Acquainted with its site only from the general impression received on approaching the city, I passed on hastily, without knowing exactly how to direct my steps: when, entering from a narrow street into a great square, I suddenly and unexpectedly turned upon this noble edifice, which, in this my first view, I beheld, not in the usual form, standing flat and monotonous, with a broad and wide-spread front ; but presenting itself obliquely, its pure white marble, its dazzling spiry fret-work, rising high and bright in light, elegant, and indistinct forms. In the shade of night the effect was superb, and for a moment 1 was indeed astonished. The vivid and a moment 1 was indeed astonished. The vivid and powerful sensations, arising from first impressions, on be¬ holding a building so beautiful and singular, cannot re¬ turn a second time. There are moments when recollec- tions of past ages crowd upon the mind—Gothic struc- tures forcibly bring to memory images of holy rites, re¬ calling the period when crusades and pilgrimages ani- mated the spirit, and filled the souls of kings, warriors, and priests—when to offer relics at the sacred shrine, to adorn altars with the gorgeous spoil taken in war, was at once the means to make peace with Heaven, and obtain power over man. I stood long gazing on this splendid edifice, which, as night closed in, I distinguish¬ ed only by the lustre of its own white marble.                            "

It is easy to use this general censure, and call this wonderful structure a“ Gothic chaos ;\" but the expression is ill applied—it is a noble remnant of Go¬ thic splendour, and well worthy the expense and pains which Buonaparte bestowed upon it.

They consist of a line of ancient build¬ ings, supported upon slender ill-fashioned Gothic pillars. under the arcades of which run a range of poor-looking shops.

Like the city, it has had its revolutions. St Ambrose was its first bishop, Attila its first destroyer; and after being rebuilt, at vast expense, by the citizens, it was again destroyed by fire. After this, Frederic the First, afraid lest the Milanese should possess themselves of the belfry, one of the most superb in Italy, threw it down, and nearly buried the church under its ruins. It was partially rebuilt by Lanfranc, who excited such enthu¬ siasm in this most popular enterprize, (it being then styled, a church for the Mother of God,) that valuable donations poured in from every quarter, the poorest in¬ habitant contributing his mite; while the high born, the noble ladies, and matrons, brought their jewels and rich¬ est ornaments as offerings. In the fourteenth century, John Galeazzo Visconti, first Duke of Milan, who had poisoned his uncle, and his wife’s father, began with zeal to rebuild the Cathedral, as a sacrifice for sin, and a peace¬ offering to Heaven for his crimes. Quarries of marble, and stores of riches, were prepared for the accomplish- ment of this holy work; which was begun after designs given by Campiglione, Nugaut, and other French as well as Italian artists. At a later period, this great work de- volved on Pellegrini, an architect who, in many other                            "

A private individual, to make peace with Heaven on his death-bed, left a donation of 230,000 crowns to finish Pellegrini’s plan ; but this great bequest was wasted, and the work still unaccomplished; insomuch, that be¬ fore the French Revolution, there remained, of all the riches devoted to it, only the inadequate sum of 60,000 francs. Buonaparte, ever delighted with any project which might bring celebrity to his name, furnished the necessary funds, to build the portal, and supply the or¬ naments which were wanting; and thus the edifice is nearly completed.

A broad flight of steps leads up to the front portals, and five gates open, on either side, to the five parts, (i. e. the nave and four aisles,) into which the body of the church is divided. From the sides of the gates run up a sort of columns, like buttresses, terminating in the most beautiful pin- nacles, richly decorated with statues, placed not only along their whole length, but upon the top of each spiry point. Rich, curious, antique, and splendid, are the ap¬ propriate terms to be used in describing them; although, were it not for the respect inspired for ancient times, and some mixture of reverence for the religious feelings which guided the founders of this Cathedral, this profusion of ornament might certainly be condemned as childish.

At the first view of this vast edifice, the mind feels a sort of impatience and confusion of thought, from not being able to catch at once the great architectural lines so as to conceive the whole composition—a sensation arising from the characteristic features that distinguish Greek and Saracenic architecture. In the first, with the exception of the supporting columns and pillars, the whole lies in great conspicuous horizontal lines, as the beams, friezes, cornices, ceilings, &amp;c.—in the latter all stands vertically, the terminations and ornaments spiral and upright; the frieze, cornice, or beams, which com- pose the uniting lines in the Grecian, being formed, in the Saracenic, by the union and junction of closing the Saracenic, by the union and junction of closing arches ; hence the lines of the Gothic are vertical, those of the Grecian horizontal. Any one slightly surveying the front of a Gothic Church must make this observa- tion. Therefore the great question of taste on this sub¬ ject seems to be, whether thin spiral, and perpendicular; or solid square, horizontal lines, are to be preferred.

The picture is now nearly lost, and all its beauty gone : and this principally owing to the whimsical theories Leonardo had conceived in the composition, and manner of laying on his colours. He is reported to have been occupied sixteen years in this painting; the chief part of which time was, I doubt not, employed in experiments more properly chemical; and, after having tried and re¬ jected many materials, he at last finished the picture in oil, on a ground composed of pitch, mastic, and plaster, combined with some fourth ingredient, and wrought with heated iron; an invention probably altogether his own, but which was afterwards used by Sebastiano del Piom¬ bo. Over this preparation he laid his fresco, a cement of burnt clay and ochre, which, being mixed up with var¬ nish, formed a colouring of great beauty, but short dura¬ tion.

He began by forming a general plan of the whole, which (with many other valuable productions of his) is unfor- tunately lost. He next proceeded to make separate sketches of the heads, of which two are still in existence, one in the possession of Prince Lichtenstein, and the other purchased, a century ago, by an Englishman. A painting on a subject of such deep interest, and by an artist so eminent, could not fail to inspire the liveliest feelings among his friends and contemporaries ; but cu¬ riosity and enthusiasm, to whatever height they might have arisen, had no remedy but patience; for, though this object constantly held the first place in the thoughts of Da Vinci, sixteen years elapsed before it was finally accomplished. Bernardo Zenale, on his expressing the difficulty of giving to the countenance of our Saviour a divine beauty and excellence, superior to that which he had already attained in those of some of the Apostles. particularly of St John, recommended him to follow the example of the celebrated Grecian artist, and leave the work unfinished; with which advice, according to one author (Lanazzo), he complied ; but this statement is entirely contradicted by every other writer.

In a public recitation, held by Antonio Massi, at Pa¬ via, rather more than a hundred years since, he says, * Inimitable beauty shone in the Saviour’s countenance, blended with a character of deep and touching melan- choly, expressive of celestial pity ; a countenance on which the eye rested with awe, love, and admiration; while all the emotions of the mind, tenderness, anxiety, suspense, or fear, might be read in the varied aspects of the Apostles. The mild and effulgent beauty of St John was relieved by the stronger and more dignified physiog- nomy of St Peter, whose features, on which truth and zeal were pourtrayed, were finely contrasted by the hag- gard visage, dark scowling eye, wild disordered looks, and sunk cheek of Judas Iscariot, who is represented, with the jealous suspicion characteristic of guilt, to be listen¬ ing to the discourse of St Peter.\" During the progress ing to the discourse of St Peter.\" During the progress of the work, the artist, as may easily be imagined, was assailed by the curiosity, or annoyed by the impatience, of those who surrounded him.

But returning to the Duke some months after, and with additional ill humour, he protested, that during the in- tervening period, not a line had been added, or brush applied; upon which assertion, Ludovico again had re¬ course to Da Vinci, who explained, in language so elo¬ quent and clear, the necessity of study and contempla¬ tion to mature his ideas on a subject so august, that the Duke was not only convinced, but charmed with the powers of mind displayed in his discourse; and from that time none dared to interfere. Leonardo was said to have revenged himself on the Prior, by making use of his countenance to represent Judas. It would be a long matter to enumerate the variety of accidents that have combined to ruin this celebrated pic¬ ture, and those occurring at a period so shortly following its completion, as to render it a subject of wonder, as well as a proof the exquisite beauty it had once possessed, that its fame has been carried through so many ages. Two circumstances have especially contributed to pre¬ serve it to posterity ; the admiration of contemporaries, who delighted in copying a favourite subject, and the diligence, taste, and talents of Morghen; and to these may be added, in the third place, the order, in the year                           "

In little more than fifty years after this painting was finished, it was found to be almost wholly destroyed. In the year 1726, it was repaired by Michael Angelo Bel¬ lotti, a presumptuous, but a good artist ; and although, according to the assertion of some, his success was owing to a secret skill in renewing the colours, I should rather conjecture, that his art was that of re-painting. At a later period, Giorgione was solicited to re-touch the pic- ture, a task which he modestly declined. In the year 1772, they found a painter less diffident, Muzza, who nearly accomplished the utter destruction of this admi¬ rable piece. He boldly brushed off the surface of the painting wherever it interrupted his progress, laying à new ground of paste, mastic, burnt umber, and ochre, on the parts which he meant to repair. He had nearly fi¬ nished the whole; St Thomas, Matthias, and Simon, alone were left untouched ; and they were in the course of were left untouched ; and they were in the course of execution, when a new Prior (Paul Galloni) saved them from his barbarous hands.

It is impossible to visit objects of this nature without a feeling of regret, in being obliged to take only à passing glance ; yet, in merely surveying such institu¬ tions, something may be gained, were it only gleaned from the conversation of the learned professors; the politeness and courtesy of their general manner was such as to lead them to take not merely pleasure, but apparently, even a pride, in attending to the visitors; evincing every solicitude to shorten their labours, and to give them every information in their power. This tribute is well due to the learned institutions which I have visited in this elegant metropolis. The descriptions I had read of the college, its galleries, sculp¬ ture, and paintings, had given me a high idea of the edi¬ fice itself.

Those adorning the outside of the houses are the labours of Fratti, Campo, Camilla, and Alonzo. The houses are chiefly built with brick, and the streets narrow, but not irregular. In one of the squares, styled Piazza di Castello, there are two equestrian statues of bronze, by some attributed to John of Bologna Fiammingo, but rather believed to be to John of Bologna Fiammingo, but rather believed to be the work of his pupil, Moca. One of the statues represents the work of his pupil, Moca. One of the statues represents Alexander Farnese, the other is that of his son, Ranuccio.

He sheltered himself from the consequences of this act by a successful crimination of many great lords of the state, seven of whom suffered in consequence of his pretended charges. He pursued his victims with his pretended charges. He pursued his victims with such severity, that, not content with depriving the chil¬ dren of these nobles of their inheritance, he threatened their lives, and they were saved only by the humanity of the priests, who secretly conveyed them beyond the reach of his power. Such is the violation of truth in the virtues we here find proclaimed. These equestrian statues, as works of art, are men- tioned in terms of the highest praise.

Among the excellen¬ cies of which fresco painting is peculiarly susceptible, the facilities it presents of giving an easy flow, a freedom of hand, and roundness of contour, together with a rich- ness and brilliancy of colouring, are chiefly remarkable.

The fresco paint¬ ing of the ceiling of this chapel, by Caracci, of the resur¬ ing of the ceiling of this chapel, by Caracci, of the resur¬ rection, is beautifully composed, and finely executed. In the choir of the Cathedral there are two paintings; one on either side, of 20 feet in height, the work of Laland, a young artist of Placentia, who had studied long in Rome. These spaces were formerly occupied by superb paintings, by Caracci, carried to Paris during the revolution, and now in Parma. Laland was permit- ted to select for this work any scriptural subject most pleasing to himself, or best suited to his talents ; but probably his mind, fixed by the recollections of the ex¬ quisite beauty of the pictures of Caracci, boldly resol¬ ved on repeating the same. Like Phaeton, he was nothing doubting; and, although his end was not as tragical, his defeat (if he were conscious of it) must have been as mortifying. The subject of the first of these pictures, is the death of the Virgin ; angels are strewing flowers over her body, while the apostles are seen weeping and mourning. The other represents the approach of the apostles to the tomb of Christ after the resurrection. There is in these works both a bulkiness of drawing, and a power of composition, which is impo¬ of drawing, and a power of composition, which is impo¬ sing, but with this great fault, that there is no pencil¬ ling.

This city, receiving the name of Parma from the Ro¬ mans, either because its form resembled that of a shield, or, perhaps, because it had served as a protection to them, was, together with Placentia, among the cities left by Charlemagne to his son Pepin. The distance of these towns from the seat of government rendered of these towns from the seat of government rendered revolt easy, and they soon erected themselves into inde¬ pendent republics. After this period, they belonged sometimes to the Duke of Milan, sometimes to the Pope; then becoming the property of the Ferranese, this family long reigned over them with the title of Dukes of Parma. Parma was next possessed by the French, in their revolutionary conquests ; and, finally, at the Congress of Vienna, was assigned to the Arch- Duchess Maria Louisa, wife of Buonaparte. In contem¬ plating Italy, its beautiful cities, valleys, and rich plains, we cannot wonder that it has so often been an object of contention, and an alluring prize to the conqueror's arm.

Parma is said to contain 28,000 souls, but neither its magnitude, nor its apparent population, gives this impression. There is no attempt at courtly gran¬ deur as at Turin ; none of the stir and busy bustle of Milan; nor anything of the filth, meanness, and confu¬ sion of Pavia ; but simply a beautiful little city, the general aspect of which is striking; the public walks, lving on the ramparts high above the town, are pleasant, as well as the roads around, which are lined with fine as well as the roads around, which are lined with fine trees.

It is positively asserted that he never visited Rome, and consequently did not enjoy the advantage of drawing from the antique statues. This seems, however, almost impossible; for at that period we find this study regard¬ ed as indispensable, and as forming the only pathway to excellence. Correggio directed his attention particularly to the art of foreshortening, in which he was singularly successful. It was his particular care always to dray from nature. Of the many fine paintings executed by this great master, esteemed the inventor of his style, so remark- able for his foreshortenings, the bold relief in his draw- ing, and the easy flow of his draperies, the work which first raised his name to distinction is the fresco painting of the cupola, or dome, of the Cathedral of Parma.

Leaving this, I proceeded to the Academy of Arts and Sciences ; and now propose merely to point out a few of the most striking or interesting pictures it contains. On entering this apartment, one of my first objects was to obtain a view of Hannibal Caracci's two celebrated paintings, from which Laland's pictures in the Cathe¬ dral of Placentia had been designed, the recollection of which, as might easily be imagined, only served to heighten the beauty of the originals. There is in the composition and execution of these, a character of gran¬ deur, mingled with a tone of deep and solemn melan¬ choly, inexpressibly touching. The figures are gigantic; but here we find size without coarseness, giving only greater nobleness to the form. The Virgin lies on a bier borne by the Apostles, and carried so high as partly to conceal their grief ; the cloak of one of them covers her form ; her eyes are closed, while her matron-like coun-                            "

The whole beauty and interest of the piece, however, rests in the main sub¬ ject, in the Virgin’s countenance, in her form, as she lies on the bier, in the fine representation of death, and in on the bier, in the fine representation of death, and in the solemn grandeur expressed in the manner and atti- the solemn grandeur expressed in the manner and atti- tude of the Apostles:—the forms of the angels are want- ing in aerial transparency ; the figures also are too dis¬ tinct; no bright halo illumines to give distance, no light clouds produce that softening hazy medium, so beautiful in the representation of the ascending and disappearing of angels, as they rise into Heaven. The piece, however, as a whole, is very fine. The companion to this painting, which represents, as 1 men- tioned in describing the copy, the approach of the Apos- tles to the tomb of Christ, and their dismay on finding it unoccupied, is not so good : in this there is no story distinctly told, an object of the first importance in composition; nor any point sufficiently prominent to in composition; nor any point sufficiently prominent to excite or fill the mind. The figures of the Apostles are of gigantic size, and possess a considerable character of grandeur; but this does not produce such an effect as to compensate for the general want of interest in the design.

The composition and exe¬ cution of this piece are both in the first style of excel¬ lence. The drawing of the figure of our Saviour is at once the most learned in point of anatomy, and the truest to nature I have ever seen; the figures of the Virgin, and the angels in the back ground, are in such keeping, as not in any degree to intrude on the picture, but are beautiful, and very natural.

The scene is the journey into Egypt; Mary is represented sitting is the journey into Egypt; Mary is represented sitting with the child, her countenance bearing all that charac- ter of feminine loveliness, which Correggio so well knew how to display. Her drapery is of a yellowish pale co- lour, light and graceful; and the action of Joseph, who, with an extended arm, is taking hold of the child's hand, finely expressed. The second is la Madonna di San Girolamo ; and also most beautiful.

Correggio was esteemed the first great master of the school of Parma of that period. Francesco Mazzuola, styled Parmegiano, the second; but the sweetness and grace of that artist is ascribed more to his study of Raf¬ faelo, than to his imitations of Correggio.

Among the works of art in this city, the fresco paint¬ ings by Hanibal Caracci, in the Palazzo Giardino, excite great interest.

While thus engaged, I could not help remarking the uncommon beauty of the people; the women, in particu¬ lar, seemed to possess a natural elegance of figure, com¬ bined with much flexibility of limb, and gracefulness of action. The artists of this city, I am told, take their designs from their fellow-citizens; and people, quite un¬ conscious of any personal merit, often find themselves introduced into fine pictures.

The ceiling of the first hall of this palace is by Ludo¬ vico Caracci, in which Jupiter with the Eagle, and Her¬ cules, are represented, and are in form, dignity of fea¬ ture, and magnificence of character, finely suited to har¬ monize as a group. The muscular figure and gigantic bulk of Hercules is imposing, without extravagance; a perfect acquaintance with the human figure is displayed, with admirable foreshortening, and great skill and bold¬ ness in composition and execution.

Neither the inven¬ tion nor composition of this piece is good : there is no tion nor composition of this piece is good : there is no aerial lightness, no delusion in the perspective; and the colouring is as flaming as if fresh from a brass-founder's shop, the figures and sky having throughout a bright brazen tint.

The ceiling of the third hall, by Augustino Caracci, represents Hercules and Atlas supporting the globe.

The figure of Hercules is very grand, but seems to have occupied rather too much of the artist’s care. It is undoubtedly necessary to keep down the subordinate characters in a piece, but hardly so much as we find it in this group. Antæus is wanting in vigour; the resisting arm is not drawn with force or in vigour; the resisting arm is not drawn with force or bulk corresponding to the action ; neither are the figures sufficiently connected.

Strength and power have been considered as the sole guides on which the Etruscan architect founded his principles ; but if force, security, and the means of defence, were originally his only objects, these soon gave place to a higher senti¬ ment, combining nobleness with strength. The great masters who flourished in the time of Cos¬ mo de Medici, could not be ignorant of Grecian archi¬ tecture ; but, while introducing Grecian ornaments, it is evident they acted on the principle of perpetuating the- Etruscan style ; the most prominent features of which, I should say, were the vast stones, the noble square forms of their edifices, and their deep, heavy, projecting cor¬ nices. The great Michael Angelo had peculiarly the talent of combing in architecture the rustic with the polish- ed, the Etruscan with the Roman, and the ancient with the modern style. The masters of that period retained the bases of the Etruscan, varied by the Roman and the bases of the Etruscan, varied by the Roman and Grecian ; but still the original styleis to be traced in all their most finished buildings, a style powerful, and peculiarly marked by strength. It was hereditary, and                            "

Strabo says, the most ancient Tuscan buildings were great masses of hewn stones, built without cement, such as neither weather nor time could destroy. In the noble edifices and palaces erected in the first ages of restored art, the Florentines have maintained the simple square forms, and grand models of earlier times. They have retained the ground stone line, the coarse rustic base, the large stones, the iron rings, the stone seat, the massiveness, squareness, and the grand project¬ ing cornice above, giving shelter from the glowing light ing cornice above, giving shelter from the glowing light of the mid-day sun.

The walls round Florence form a circumference of five miles, and, in ancient times, were guarded by sixteen towers, having an equal number of gates. In the year 1455, Cosmo de Medici caused the circle of the wall to be extended, at which period the towers were either en¬ tirely demolished, or cut down, their existence being now only to be traced where their foundations were left to                            "

The people, willing to regain that liberty which they thought had been invaded by some of the measures of Alexander, one of the descend- ants of the Medici, had dispossessed him of his authority, and banished him the city Charles the Fifth of Germany, and Pope Clement the Seventh, espousing his cause, advanced with their united force against Florence.

It served as a castle for him and for his faction; it was a protection to his palace, to which it was attached, and rose in grandeur above the walls of the city. Within the ponderous jaws of the narrow portal of this fort, a stout man in armour was a defence against a thousand. Beneath the tower was a strongly vaulted a thousand. Beneath the tower was a strongly vaulted portico, and through the roof this, by a small square opening, was a passage into the tower, which was ascend¬ ed by means of a rope. When Totila spoiled the city, there were sixty-two towers defended by gentlemen of Florence. These arch- ed porticos were the places of resort for the Guelph and Ghibelline factions.

One thing is peculiarly worthy of notice—the divi¬ sions and coarse chisellings of the rubble-work, with which the bases of these great edifices are ornamented, are essential to the effect and composition. It is like a wash in drawing, which, however slight, takes off the cold white glare, and gives a colour such as hatching does in engraving. The gravity and solemnity of the stately mass is thus ensured, and the glare of an ardent sun, which often proves injuriously dazzling, is corrected. Were it not owing to this, such vast edifices as the pa¬ laces of the Strozzi or Ricardi, smooth and fair as a villa, would present a tame and insipid front, vast without grandeur, and requiring columns or other massive en¬ richments to give relief. This hatching contributes to gravity as well as ornament, uniting the whole, and giving the bases apparent strength to support the weight above. Men of talents different from those of St Gallo or Michael Angelo, attempted to amend and refine, by polishing and smoothing a grave and magnificent front, which derived grandeur from its dimensions.

Whatever offences may have been committed, whether robbery, murder, petty larceny, or prostitution, to which the wretched female is too often driven by beggary and famine, the mode of confinement is the same; and there seems to be no gradation in punishment. The solitary prisoner is not more guilty than another, who, perhaps, forms a group with his family.

These ministers of state were elected every two months, during which period they shared the same table, which was served at the public expense ; nor were they suffered to absent themselves, even for a single day, on any pretext whatsoever. It appears that the original plan designed by Arnolfo for this building was finer than that finally adopted. It united symmetry with grandeur, and would have enabled him to plant the building, which now stands obliquely, in fair and just proportion. But he met with insurmountable obstacles. Among the buildings to be thrown down to clear a suf- ficient space for this great fabric, the habitations of the Ubati, attached to the Ghibellini faction, were designa¬ ted, and it was in vain that the architect reasoned or entreated ; he could not prevail with the people to suffer that any part or portion of the National Palace should touch the ground which these habitations had occupied; and while thus obstinate in their antipathies, their pre¬ dilection in favour of the antique tower of the Tira¬ bosche della Vacha led them to insist on it being incor¬ porated in the building.

The entrance into the palace is through a superb but gloomy court, of an oblong form, supported on massive columns. These pillars, in the year 1798, were, with singular skill and science, substituted for those originally planted by Arnolfo. They are eight feet in circumfe¬ rence, of admirable proportions, with plain but varied capitals. Two figures, or Termini of Marble, by Bandinelli, are painted in the entrance of the court, which is adorn¬ ed by a number of statues of gigantic proportions.— Among these, a Hercules slaying Cacus, by V. Rossi of Fiesole, a scholar of Bandinelli, is considered fine, and in many points certainly it may be regarded as having in many points certainly it may be regarded as having merit. But the Florentine school had fallen into the bad taste of representing strength by mere bulkiness, (witness their statues in the hall of this palace.)

Square forms and limbs, muscles crowded and knotted together, with a flat coarse face, and rough hair, go but a little way in expressing strength. Passing along a gloomy staircase, leading to the great hall of this palace, you enter an apartment of vast and magnificent dimensions, of beautiful proportions, and fine architecture. The windows are noble, the light splendid, the walls richly painted, and lined with marble statues. A great flat form crosses the apartment, occu¬ pying nearly a sixth part of the whole floor, from which you look down on the greater part below. The general effect is singularly striking and grand. The mind invo¬ luntarily figures the vast space spread out before you, filled, as in the times when it was erected, with conten¬ tious nobles and turbulent citizens, each girded with his sword, and bearing his spear and shield; you imagine his sword, and bearing his spear and shield; you imagine them in all the perturbation and fury of a revolutionary throng, rising into some deed of passion, and filling the city with tumult and slaughter. From this platform, which runs along the whole width of the room, you de¬ scend into the hall below, which is about 150 feet in length, and 60 in width, with a most magnificent height of ceiling.

Hercules seems to pound with his club with the deliberation of one who is playing with a Centaur, not killing him. Hercules and Cacus, by the same artist, are finished with exquisite skill and care ; but still the demigod lays on with polite deliberation, and Cacus, half raised on his elbow, submits with commendable quietness of de¬ meanour. A statue, in the costume of a Roman General, by this artist, has considerable merit ; the posture is easy, the limbs are large, full, and round, without being clum- sy ; the drapery too is good, and the helmet finely exe¬ cuted.

The right hand sustains a light thin drapery, which falls gracefully in slender folds, and the left knee is planted on the shoulder of the prostrate enemy.

It is unfinished; the block evidently being too small to fur¬ nish materials for the bulky limbs of the prostrate King or Prince. There are four Grecian statues, good, but not excel¬ lent.

His large-featured grim visage, and square form, enveloped in a voluminous cloak of the rudest stuff, turned back upon the forehead as a monk's cowl, is to¬ tally out of keeping and harmony with the other figures.

Every part marks the bold chisel of Michael Angelo; but aware how much of the character of the hand arm depend upon the form of the wrist and its promi¬ nent bones, he has here, as in all his sketches, caricatured the wrist, as if he were setting his figure for some young pupil, and was fearful lest it should be too feebly marked. *                             "

In seeking for those specimens of architecture most worthy of attention in Florence, the arcade styled Log- gia dei Lanzi, is an object of peculiar interest, from its singular beauty and magnificence. It was usual in the early periods of this republic, and the practice was one in which they followed the ancients, to provide à space close to the government house, or seat of power, where the whole body of the people might meet in one great the whole body of the people might meet in one great assembly, to take their share in public affairs, to which they were summoned by the tolling of the great bell of the city. The space originally allotted by the architect of the Palazzo Vecchio for this purpose, was guarded by a noble railing, but offered no shelter from the weather; to ob¬ viate which inconvenience, in the year 1355, the Loggia dei Lanzi was built in one angle of the square. The erection of this edifice naturally excited great interest ; and the object accordingly was pursued with that zeal and emulation, which then so peculiarly characterized this people. At the conclusion of many debates, and keen discussions, the design presented by Orcagna, an artist celebrated for his singular attainments in the 2E.                          "

The building presents a magnificent colonnade, or open gallery, consisting of only three pillars, and three arches; but these are large, spacious, and noble. Five steps run along the front on which the platform is raised, with fine effect, giving a certain air of grandeur to the whole. The columns rise out of a short and highly or- namented plinth, on flat clustered pilasters, great and small being bound together, in one vast massive shaft of thirty-five feet in height, terminating in a rich and beau¬ tiful capital of the Corinthian order. The shaft proceeds from a curved base, embellished by the arms of the re¬ public, a lion sitting on its haunches.

He is re- presented as having just cut off the head of Medusa, which, streaming with blood, he holds up in triumph; his foot is firmly planted on the mangled body of the fallen sorceress ; while his right hand, still vigorously grasping the sword, is in a retracted position, ready to strike again, as if the act were hardly done, the danger not yet over. The head with the winged helm is noble, and the countenance princely. The posture is fine, the action full of animation and life, the forms powerful, and free from all affectation of science, in knobs, joints, and muscles. The whole is gracefully simple, and executed with such elegance and beauty of proportion, that, al- though it is fully seven feet high, it has the effect of a light youthful figure, not exceeding the usual size. So truly do I admire the Perseus, that I feel unwilling to point out any of its faults ; it must, however, be re¬ marked, that the head and body of Medusa are repre¬ sented streaming with blood, with a revolting exaggera¬ tion, which is neither true to nature or good taste ; that the fallen body of the sorceress is too much mangled, the fallen body of the sorceress is too much mangled, and uncouthly bundled up below the feet of Perseus ; as also that, instead of being thrown on the naked rock, it lies on a velvet cushion.

OF THE STATUES IN THE SQUARE. Before the gate of Palazzo Vecchio stand two statues, Hercules, by Donotello, and David, by Michael Angelo.

The figure is manly, the countenance dignified; he sits his horse with the air of a conqueror, and carries his baton with much grace. The story of the vanquished city is well told, in basso relievo, on the base of the pedestal.

Pyramids, or obelisks, placed in the centre of a city, unless very delicate and slender, should be of granite, or black marble, and their aim that of producing relief to the more massive buildings by which they are surrounded. This vast colossal statue, from its bulk, becomes almost architectural, while its brilliancy assimilates ill with the antique grandeur of the square. If, instead of being crowded into one place, these sta¬ tues, classed and arranged, were planted in different quarters of the city, each would have its full effect, and each artist receive his just meed of praise. Even if the zigzag antique forms of this square were to be altered and its dimensions enlarged, one would be pleased to see Neptune presiding over the bridges, and David and Her¬ cules supporting or defending the immense heavy mass of the Palazzo Pitti.

IN proceeding to offer a few observations on the churches of this city, I am induced to select San Lorenzo for my first subject, not so much as the most conspicuous in architecture, as from the peculiar interest it derives from its connexion with the tomb of the Medici, which forms one of its chapels. Inthe earlier periods of the republic, San Lorenzo was considered the Metropolitan Church of Florence. Its existence is traced as far back as the year 393, when it was consecrated by St Ambrose ; at the distance of nearly three hundred years, on its receiving some repairs and embellishments, this ceremony was again performed by Pope Nicholas the Second in person. 2 F                     "

A few vears afterwards it was again rebuilt from a design of Brunelleschi. The whole structure is considered as fine, an opinion sanctioned by Michael Angelo himself; but, according to my idea, its general aspect possesses none of that beauty arising from just proportions, so essential to sim¬ plicity and grandeur in architecture. It measures nearly 400 feet in length, and only 100 in width, (not including the chapels,) the body of the church is therefore ungrace the chapels,) the body of the church is therefore ungrace fully long, while the cross is proportionably too short. These defects are rendered more conspicuous by the unusual height of the pillars that divide the parts of the church, and which greatly contribute to make the inter- mediatespaces appear still more narrow. The church itself may be said to possess few claims to admiration ; but its chapels are highly interesting. One of these was planned by Cosmo, first Grand Duke of Florence, after a design of Vasari's, being intended as a Mausoleum for the Medicean family. At a later period, the original intention having been partly changed, and the whole enlarged, it was finished under the auspices of his successor, Ferdinand the First.

The marbles and precious stones, with which it is adorned, are finely varied, giving a rich and glowing harmony of colour, brilliant, yet chaste and simple.

I shall, however, touch but slightly on the architecture of the interior of the chapel, which greatly disappointed me. It is a large square room, formal and unadorned, having regular Corinthian pilasters, and corresponding doors and windows, arranged in that tame flat style of mixed architecture, so unpropitious to the so¬ lemn and imposing gloom of a mausoleum. The pilasters are painted of a cold grey colour, while the walls are left are painted of a cold grey colour, while the walls are left entirely of a pure white, the whole being gay, light, and showy, but most unimpressive.

But from the architecture and ornaments of the cha¬ pel, we turn with the deepest interest to the statues of Michael Angelo; till I beheld them, I had formed no conception of the splendour of genius and taste possess¬ ed by this artist ; they are works which evince a gran- deur and originality of thought, a boldness and freedom of design and execution, unparalleled. Two sarcophagi, those of Lorenzo and Julian, are each supported by two figures.

The Aurora is a female form of the most exquisite proportions; the head of a grand heroic cast, and the drapery, which falls in thin transparent folds from the turban, is full of grace, while, in her noble counte- nance, a spring of thought, an awakening principle, seems                           "

To have done more would have di¬ minished the noble effect of the whole, which is only heightened by what is left to the imagination.

There is also an error in the composition, which greatly lessens the dignity of the whole; the figure of Nicodemus is too small, bearing no proportion to the form of our Saviour ; this has the uni¬ ted bad effect of giving an appearance of too great bulk to the body of our Saviour, and consequent feebleness to the sustaining figure. Nicodemus, a well-bearded, square, and rather vulgar personage, is Bandinelli's portrait of and rather vulgar personage, is Bandinelli's portrait of himself.

The sepulchre of Michael Angelo is a grand piece of sculpture. His bust, the work of B. Lorenzi, is finely executed, and esteemed a perfect resemblance of the art¬ ist. The three mourning figures, representing the sister arts, are the work of his disciples. Of the great names among the remains deposited in this church, that of Galileo bears a distinguished place. This great man, though late, yet at length obtained the honours due to his high talents. This tomb was erected by the gratitude and respect of one of his pu¬ pils, and the whole accomplished at the private expense of a noble Florentine family.

This last was the first distinguished work by which his talents were made known. We have an interesting account of this fact in his life, where we learn that, in order to surprise Brunelleschi, he pur- sued his labour in secret, and when it was finished, he asked him carelessly to step in, as he was passing by, to survey his works, when he offered this specimen to his view. On beholding it, Brunelleschi uttered an excla¬ mation of surprise and delight, that thrilled the heart of the artist. This warm, honest, and simple expression of admiration, being the more admirable in Brunelleschi, as the idea of the work had been originally conceived by Donatello, with the avowed intention of surpassing a de- sign of his on the same subject.

ON viewing the works of ancient art, we are naturally led to inquire into the causes which produced such early and almost unrivalled excellence in statuary and sculpture. The answer is to be found in the manners of the Greeks, which peculiarly encouraged the progress the Greeks, which peculiarly encouraged the progress of talent in these pursuits, and offered the finest oppor¬ of talent in these pursuits, and offered the finest oppor¬ tunities for study. Every ceremony of their poetic re- ligion—the rites observed at their marriages and public festivals—their funeral processions and public games, were so many occasions for rousing talent, and present¬ ing to the artist the finest models for his imitation and study. This was peculiarly the case with regard to sculpture. In the Olympic games, and other exhibitions of the same kind, where the highest honours were bestowed                    "

He saw, in these displays of agility and strength, the noblest forms in all the animation of contest ; and roused to the greatest exertion by that hope of distinction, which the rewards bestowed on the successful competi¬ tor were so well calculated to produce. But besides this, the artists themselves were honoured and distinguished in a manner unknown in modern times.

The effect that est degree were bestowed upon them. The effect that this must have had in exciting animation and talent is evident. The nature of their mythology was equally import¬ ant. In our religion the subjects are grand, noble, and impressive ; but almost too sacred for the pencil or chisel. The mythology of the Greeks was, on the con¬ trary, gay and animating. Even while seeking to repre- sent the splendour of the Deity, grand severe in dignity, the ancients have surpassed us. There is no comparison between the Almighty, by Raphael, and the Jupiter of Phidias, as described by ancient writers.

Thus, in every subject there the efforts of imagination. Thus, in every subject there is poetry. Composition may be styled the sentiment- the pencil and chisel the language, of painting and the pencil and chisel the language, of painting and sculpture. The delight of an artist must indeed be infinite in imagining and producing a fine group, or in forming a beautiful and perfect model of the human body.

The ancients had no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the formation of the human body, except what might be the result of accident; after death the body was burnt, and the funeral urn contained its ashes. Their emblems of death were not like ours, the repre- sentations of the form into which the body is at length resolved; their signs were expressed by mourning genii, with an extinguishing torch.

One circumstance strongly indicating that the chief studies of the Greek artist had been in the Circus, is, that nearly all their male figures are nudes, especially when in action, such as their wrestlers, athletæ, gladia¬ tors, and discoboli. The ancients were also particularly well acquainted with one great principle in the fine arts, viz. that exaggerated expression, caricatured violent or strong action, instead of bespeaking the sympathy of the beholder, only weakens the effect, producing disgust ra¬ ther than pleasure.

To the first query I should reply by asking, what need had they of anatomy, who studied so well a surer rule? what could it offer to those, who like them had the means of viewing, in the living body, the most perfect forms of manly beauty? To the second I should answer, that anatomy, skilfully and sparingly applied, is the best substitute for the more animated exhibitions of the circus and theatre. the circus and theatre. While I maintain that the statuary who has only ana- tomy for his master, possesses advantages very inferior to those enjoyed by the spectator at the games of the to those enjoyed by the spectator at the games of the Circus, I neverthless admit, that a man skilled in ana¬ tomy will never produce anything very bad or offensive; his science must correct the eye, although it cannot ex¬ cite the imagination. T also think that an acquaintance with the great outlines and leading rules in anatomy, would, in any circumstances, prove advantageous to an artist. Polycletus, a man of learning, as well as an able sculptor, wrote a treatise on statuary ; and, to give per¬ manence to his rules, formed an exquisitely beautiful statue, demonstrative of the proportions and measures of the human body, which he himself styled the canon,                            "

In the second stage of his studies, the artist is called upon to observe the changes formed by the bendings of the figure, the consequent swell of muscle, the increa¬ the figure, the consequent swell of muscle, the increa¬ sed sharpness of the elbow joint, the turning of the hand wrist-bones, viz. the radius and ulna, the cur¬ ving of the spine, the projection of the haunch, and flat- tening of the knee.

I should recommend to a statuary, who hopes to rise to excellence, not to practise too long, or assiduously, the modelling in basso or alto relievo. It is a manner chiefly adapted to sketches, being rapid and pleasing, and having an air of delicacy, elegance, and even a touch of antiquity, which renders it too seducing, and may thus spoil his hand, and retard his progress.

But the Dancing Fawn does not come under this description: it is allied with their mythology, similar to their basso re- lievos of fawns, satyrs, and bacchantes, and is rather to be designated by the word sportive, than ludicrous.

The limbs are all in a strained and stagger- ing attitude. The action arises not from the exertion of dancing, but from the loss of balance, and a desire to pre¬ serve it.

Instead of the dancing, it should be the drunken fawn.

The whole front view of this statue is exquisitely fine; and, if the forms had been but a little rounder, I think that even the most fastidious critic would have judged that nothing in antiquity could have surpassed, perhaps hardly equalled it. This not, however, the view in which the artist himself takes his chief pride, nor the spectators the greatest delight ; they say he excels in the back. I lament this opinion, because 1 cannot bring myself to share it. To my idea, the back represents a tame flat line, which, together with a slight degree of too great length in the left leg, may be mentioned as in- juring this exquisitely beautiful work of art. In compa¬ ring the impressions excited in viewing the rival god¬ desses of Florence, I should say that the Medicean Ve- nus displays in her whole deportment a mild repose, a tranquil dignity, that leads the mind to forget her situ¬ ation; while the modest, though captivating timidity be¬ trayed by Canova’s Venus, awakens the attention, and excites something of uneasiness, by compelling you to share her alarm.

This statue of Niobe presents a large full figure, richly draped ; but her garments, instead of falling in careless easy folds, marking the bendings of the body, are heavy and cumbrous, like a profusion of gaudy colouring, which frequently only serves to cover bad drawing. Her young- est child is placed in her arms, and clings to the girdle round her waist; whilst the mother is looking up to¬ wards Heaven; by some thought to be in the act of fly¬ ing, and by others in that of offering up a prayer for the preservation of her only remaining child.

The expression is stern, the tenderness of the parent. The expression is stern, and the forms are coarse. The restored arms are very ill supplied. The artist has placed a sword in his hand. The head is suspected, but the bearded face is fine, the scraggy neck admirably in keeping with the figure, and the entangled straight locks, described by Juvenal as characteristic of the Pedagogue, are in a style on which a modern artist would hardly have ventured. a modern artist would hardly have ventured.

And yet I would not give one solitary midnight hour in Florence, in which I can wander through her deserted streets, see the long per- spective, and wonder, at each angle, how the narrow arches, and opposing buttresses, are to open up into other succeeding lines, for whole weeks of idle sights. My first impressions of Florence have all been by moonlight, in solitary evening walks. The heats of the day are excessive, and as there is no twilight, it is in the serene and silent midnight hour that you love to wander forth, and inhale the cool breeze and freshened air- How beautiful it is to gaze on the splendour of the moonbeams, reflected on the Arno, showing its bridges in grand perspective, the city, and its huge masses of ancient buildings, lying in deep full shadow before you. the rays hardly reaching to the centre of the narrow the rays hardly reaching to the centre of the narrow streets, while they glitter on the tops of towers and buildings, whose projecting square roofs, almost touch¬ ing each other, rear their ponderous bulk against the clear blue sky. In such a night as this, (the calm night of a sultry day,) sallying forth, as was my custom, and passing through narrow alleys, I chanced to enter a market-place, chiefly resorted to by the poorer inhabitants of the city. 2P                             "

Among those composing the different groups, tall finely-formed women with dishevelled hair, pale faces, and care-worn counte¬ nances, made a conspicuous part. These, with the ven¬ ders of meat, their boys, dogs, and men, stalking with bare arms and grisly visages, filled up the picture; while dim and infrequent lamps darkly showed all the dis- malness of the place, and the wretchedness of the food they were purchasing. Amongthe crowd I distinguished a woman, who, with her little daughter, sat apart, at a distance from the busy, boisterous crew, waiting while her husband bargained for what their necessities required. She seemed poor as the others ; but she was beautiful, and presented one of the others ; but she was beautiful, and presented one of those feeling-touching countenances, which the eye of a painter would have dwelt on with delight ; one which a painter would have dwelt on with delight ; one which Da Vinci might have followed, and such as Carlo Dolce would have copied for one of his Madonnas.

Impressed by the feelings excited by the grandeur of the scene, I still pro- longed my walk, and insensibly wandered on.

A dead crow fell from the air, and three boys, at whose feet it had dropped, tossed it towards each other in play. These three boys died, and soon after the plague broke out, and in its fearful ravages desolated the city. During its continu¬ ance, a few individuals, firm in purpose and strong in piety, self-devoted, attended on the sick and dying, and the survivors of these chosen few, afterwards taking the monastic habits and order of Brothers of Misericordia, assumed for life the performance of those services which in the hour of anguish and sorrow they had voluntarily fulfilled.

That a being should be driven by the anguish of a lacerated conscience to seek relief in the gloom and solitude of so severe an order, as that of La Trappe and others, must ever appear at once touching and awful ; but instances of this nature are rare, and when they do occur, the efficacy of such self¬ sacrifice must be measured by the degree of restored peace imparted to the wounded spirit.

The Cathedral. originally a temple of Bacchus, and probably entirely of Grecian architecture, was converted, in the year 1028, into a church, by Giacopô Bavaro. It now exhi¬ bits a wild and capricious combination of the Greek and Gothic style ; but its aspect possesses a mingled ex¬ pression of simplicity and grandeur, infinitely pleasing. The gateway and western front are plain and singular, but in a fine pure taste. The entrance is by a descent of two steps, which produces a mournful and gloomy im- pression. The interior of the church is of magnificent dimensions; the side-aisles are divided from the body of the church by superb granite columns, crowned with ill- assorted capitals of white marble, of the composite or¬ der, skilfully varied, but often too small for their co¬ lumns, as if collected from some more ancient and more magnificent temple.

The exquisite polish of this precious morceau adds infinitely to its beauty. This fine finish, and consequent lustre of marble, producing a quality of softened light and shade, bearing, in statuary, a character analogous to colour in painting, is indispensable where the artist's chief aim is directed to the display of beauty in person or countenance. The MELEAGER of the Vatican affords a remarkable proof the justice of this observation, the general effect of this celebrated statue being much injured by an ab- sence of this distinguishing feature in the art. The Meleager resembles the Antinous; but, upon the whole, with some few exceptions, is inferior. The coun¬ tenance is animated, the eye intelligent, the mouth just opening, the features and expression beautiful, and the action and turn of the head implying reflection, in all of which points he surpasses his rival, whose fine features are fixed and motionless.

No; he looks not beyond himself, he feels that the wound he looks not beyond himself, he feels that the wound is mortal; he raises himself for a moment on his yet is mortal; he raises himself for a moment on his yet powerful arm, to try his strength; but his limbs have the trailing, bending form of dying languor; he looks down upon his now useless weapon, and blood-stain- ed shield ; he is wounded, his limbs have failed, he ed shield ; he is wounded, his limbs have failed, he has staggered and fallen down, and has raised himself has staggered and fallen down, and has raised himself for a moment to fall down again and die.

Its influence ought only to be felt; and to render it available, the artist must be well practised in general effect ; like perspective, it is a good rule to as¬ sist the eye, in what a good eye could do without a guide. In the Antinous, the anatomist would look in vain to detect even the slightest mistake or misconcep- tion; yet such is the simplicity of the whole composi¬ tion, so fine and undulating the forms, that a trifling er¬ ror would appear as a gross fault.

I have hardly ever seen in the statues of the ancients, and certainly never in their finest works, the Antinous, the Apollo, the Gladiator, &amp;c. a muscle caricatured. I think I can easily perceive that even the great Michael Angelo himself was not ex¬ empt from entertaining too great a fondness for a doc¬ trine, new, as applied to statuary, and in his zeal to ren¬ der it effective, we sometimes find him, in pursuit of his object, while aiming at expression, only producing coarse¬ ness. Something of this may be traced in his celebrated Mosè, in San Pietro in Vincolo. It is a noble work, and one in which the artist evidently meant to display his ac- quaintance with anatomy; but in searching too curiously after science, the grand general result has partly escaped him, the outline having many conspicuous defects. Nor is the general detail faultless. The right arm, full, mus¬ cular, and nervous, is fine, especially in the anatomy, and well proportioned to the size of the figure, but seems too large, contrasted with the left, which is mean, scrag¬ gy, and altogether in a different tone of composition, as also defective in the very art in which he sought to shine, having mistaken the origins of the pronator, and of the biceps.

THE ceremonies of the Holy Week, giving at this sea¬ son character to Rome, are very splendid. Yet, while con- templating the magnificence displayed in their churches, the heart involuntarily reverts, with a pleasing glow, to the memory of the simple forms of worship in our own the memory of the simple forms of worship in our own country. There is nothing commendable in the Roman Catholic religion, but that the church is always open, a sanctuary to the afflicted. There he can lay his distract- ed head against a pillar, or sit upon the steps of an al¬ tar, to compose a mind ruffled with the cares of this world, or stung by its ingratitude. There the sinner may meditate upon eternity, and the blessed promise made to him“ that turneth away from his wickedness,                    "

There was a time, in ruder ages, when Rome saw her streets crowded with pilgrims from every distant land ; when all the splendour of princely grandeur, and the in- fluence of princely humility, were displayed; kings and emperors walking their penitential rounds, and receiving pardon and absolution. Then was exhibited the imposing spectacle of our Saviour’s entrance into the Holy City. The priests, and the Pope himself, singing hosannas, carrying palm branches, and opening the gates. Then the washing of the pilgrims' feet, placing them at table, giving them the pilgrims' feet, placing them at table, giving them food, and dismissing them with presents, were acts of unaffected humility towards those who had traversed seas and deserts, to cast themselves before the throne of the Pope, to kiss his feet and his garment.

The exquisite notes of the soprano al¬ most charmed away criticism; but yet we could not help being conscious of the difficulties attending a composi¬ tion of this nature, even in the hands of so great a mas¬ ter as Allegri, whose music it was; nor of perceiving that, after a time, the continued strain and measured answering chorus becomes monotonous, and the mind insensibly sinks into languor. Yet the whole is very fine: it is as if a being of another world were heard la¬ menting over a ruined city, with the responses of a de¬ jected people, and forms a grand mournful prepa¬ ration for the Miserere. The last light being extinguished, the chorus, in hur¬ ried sounds, proclaims that our Saviour is betrayed; then, for a moment, as a symbol of the darkness in which the moral world is left, the deepest obscurity prevails; when at the words “ Christus est mortuus,\" the Pope, the whole body of clergy and the people, knelt, (in former times, they fell down on the earth,) and all was silent, when the solemn pause was broken by the commencing of the Miserere, in low, rich, exquisite strains, rising softly on the ear, and gently swelling into powerful sounds of se- raphic harmony.

The music is composed of two choruses of four voices ; the strain begins low and so¬ lemn, rising gradually to the clear tones of the first so¬ prano, which at times are heard alone; at the conclu¬ sion of the verse, the second chorus joins, and then by degrees the voices fade and die away. The soft and al- most imperceptible accumulation of sound, swelling in mournful tones of rich harmony, into powerful effect, and then receding, as if in the distant sky, like the la- menting song of angels and spirits, conveys, beyond all conception to those who have heard it, the idea of dark- ness, of desolation, and of the dreary solitude of the tomb. A solemn silence ensues, and not a breath is heard, while the inaudible prayer of the kneeling Pope continues. When he rises, slight sounds are heard, by de¬ grees breaking on the stillness, which has a pleasing ef- fect, restoring, as it were, the rapt mind to the ex¬ istence and feelings of the present life. The effect of those slow, prolonged, varied, and truly heavenly strains, will not easily pass from the memory.                          "

There, under the superb dome built by Michael Angelo, the solemn mass is sung in deep si¬ lence, amidst the assembly of priests and princes. The morning was serene and lovely, the sun shone clear and bright through the edifice, giving to its imposing dimen¬ sions, and noble architecture, a more than usual splen¬ dour. At the end of the great cross, terminating in the grand altar, the Pope is seated, supported on either side by his cardinals and bishops, with their attendant priests, présenting à numerous and gorgeous array. The marble balustrade encircling the altar, is lined within by the guards, and spreading out at the further ends, galleries are extended, destined for royal visitors, princes, and am¬ bassadors, on the one hand, and on the other, for stran- gers of all classes.

The approach to St Peter's is very grand, the space within the court immense, and the columns and colonnades most magnificent; while the noble and high buildings of the Vatican are seen tower- ing on the right hand in a broad style of irregular but fine architecture. Large flat steps, ascending to the wide-spreading gates of the church, run to the whole length of the edifice, producing, from their vast extent, one of its most striking features; while over the low, square-roofed, and not unpicturesque buildings, in front of St Peter’s, the eye wanders abroad to the distant pros¬ pect, to the blue hills, and far-seen glaciers, the effect being altogether solemn, and fine beyond imagination. The ample steps of St Peter’s were peopled by thou- sands of the peasantry, who crowded from every distant part of the Campagna, mingling with citizens of the lower ranks: those of the higher classes, forming rich and showy groups, were seen on each side, covering the fine flat-roofed colonnades.

Beyond, stood, like a deep dark phalanx, the carriages and innumerable equipages, the vivid tints of the brilliant mid-day sun giving every variety of colour. by deepened shade or added brightness. In the central balcony of the church, awaiting the approach of the Pope. were seated a rich gorgeous throng of cardinals and pre- lates, overlooking the countless numbers in the space below, covered without spot or interval as with one mass of living beings. Expectation prevailed throughout, till his holiness approached, when, in a moment, all was still; every eye turned from the gay and sunny scene to the dark front of St Peter's, lying deep in shade, from its massive columns; not a breath, not a sound reached the ear. The deep silence that reigned amid such a con- course was most impressive; the whole scene excited feelings of the deepest interest, as we contemplated the pale, benign, mild countenance and venerable as¬ pect of him, who was now bending forward with anxious zeal to bless the surrounding multitude. The rich deep- toned bell of St Peter's announced the conclusion of the benediction—solemn sounds, which were instantly an- swered by the loud pealing cannon of Castle St Angelo. as likewise by the voices of the musicians, and clamorous rejoicings of the people.

No place or city affords so magnificent a scene, for exhibiting the alternate effects of brilliant illumination and sudden darkness, of utter silence and overwhelming sounds.

Perfect still¬ ness prevailed, and all was dark, except the great altar.

The light beaming across, touched with partial gleams their lowly bending forms, now enveloped in a deeper shade, now displayed with more vivid glare as it played around the sunken cheek and thinned hair, growing scanty on the cold uncovered head, the shrivelled hands meekly folded. or the glistening eye raised in fervour to heaven.

Although I had been much struck with the noble aspect of this ancient church, and altogether impressed by the recollections left on my mind at my first entrance within its venerable walls, I did not again revisit the Aracali till at a-much later period, when, passing along the Piazzo di Campidoglio, my attention was accident- ally attracted by perceiving a number of people assem¬ bled at the gates of the church, some of whom, seemingly, were loitering and stationary, while the greater portion passed in. In the season of Lent, it is very usual among the priests and brothers of the monastic orders to pro¬ the priests and brothers of the monastic orders to pro¬ nounce discourses in the different churches, which being always poured forth at the inspiration of the moment, and delivered with that powerful energy so peculiarly characterizing the manner of the Improvvisatore, may not improperly be classed as appertaining to this style of composition.

These were composed of various classes, but more especially of such as are daily seen, forming little groups in every quarter of Rome; thin slight-made figures, their cloaks, with an effect not unpicturesque, carelessly thrown over one shoulder, playing at the game of Mora; beings, whose means of existence seem as inexplicable as their mode of life.

Some stood with downcast looks, serious and re¬ flecting,—others walked softly along, now seen, now lost among the pillars; while the larger portion, who had been as it were surprised by their emotion into a mo¬ mentary taciturnity, were hastily forming into groups and beginning, in whispered accents, to converse with that eagerness and vivacity which so peculiarly charac- terize their nation. But soon, above these murmuring sounds, the full, deep-toned voice of the preacher struck the ear, when suddenly all was again hushed to silence. Slow and solemn he opened his discourse ; but, as he pro¬ ceeded, his features became gradually more animated; his dark, deep, eloquent eye kindling as he spoke, and throw- ing momentary radiance over his wan and haggard coun- tenance, while the round mellow tones of the Italian lan- guage gave the finest energy to his expressions.

The peculiar temperament and distinctive national cha¬ racteristic of the Italian, are likewise in alliance with this mode of composition ; the vivacity, the ardour, the passionate feelings that animate and impel them to sud¬ den bursts of excitation and enthusiasm, being most propitious to its production. We may at the same time observe, how much peculiar habit, prevailing in different parts of Italy, directs these feelings. We have seen the sculptor painter in Florence followed with an extravagance of admiration, which in our colder clime an extravagance of admiration, which in our colder clime would seem delirium, a whole street bearing a name in memory of the rejoicings occasioned by the success of a painter, and the contention between rival artists becom¬ ing a national concern.
