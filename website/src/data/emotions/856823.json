The roads there, very unlike the paths of human beings, are little better than goat tracks, and do not offer much choice as to the means of travelling, which are limited to riding on mules or in the lettiga, a vehicle per\u00ac fectly resembling a rude species of Brighton or Chelten\u00ac ham fly, suspended like a sedan chair, between two poles, on the backs of a couple of mules, one behind the other on the backs of a couple of mules, one behind the other before. The motion is irregular and disagreeable beyond description, attended at the same time with considerable danger of upsetting, if not driven with the greatest care over craggy and uneven ground, and particularly along the edges of precipices, where a false step would hurl the whole establishment into the plain below, in spite of the sure\u00ac footedness of the beasts that usually bear them. Therefore, after due consideration, we determined on hiring mules as the more preferable and independent mode of conveyance; besides which, what is infinitely more essential to the tourist, he can uninterruptedly gaze around him, and dwell at leisure on the prospects he beholds without the inter- vention of pannels, dirty curtains, and the intollerable nuisance of a small window, which on the occurrence of any remarkable objects or scenery, occasions an incessant interchange of most inconvenient courtesy. Travelling too in Sicily is attended with a variety of other inconveniences, particularly to those persons who are more devoted to the consideration of physical comforts and luxury than intellectual gratification ; for, excepting at two or three of the larger towns of the island, few inns are to be met with beyond the halting places of muleteers,                                   ",

Alicata occupies the site of the ancient and renowned Gela, which, according to the authority of Polybius and others, was colonized forty-five years after Syracuse by a party of Cretans and Rhodians, under Eutimus and Anti- phemus, who attached to it the appellation of the river so named by the Siculi, on account of the dense vapours that frequently occurred at its surface. It speedily rose to repute, considerably distinguished itself in the wars between its tyrant Hypocrates and his neighbours, and became so popu\u00ac lous and powerful a city, that, in one hundred and eight years from its building, it founded and colonized the cele\u00ac brated city of Akragas; but, like a sorrowful parent that is doomed to outlive the ruin of his child, Gela survived is doomed to outlive the ruin of his child, Gela survived the destruction of this splendid colony, and gave sanctuary to its wretched sons as they fled from the merciless de- stroyers of Himilco\u2019s Carthaginian host, who, in turn, ulti\u00ac mately laid it in ruins. Timoleon, however, recolonized it, but it was again fated to be destroyed, and it had entirely lost all its importance before the Romans conquered Sicily\u201c.

It was colonized by the Romans, who built there an amphitheatre, and gymnasium; the former the baron has recently discovered in the course of his excavations, an occupation in which his love of enter- prise seems to constitute his principal hobby, which is, however, fet\u00ac tered by the narrow policy of an illiberal government, that prohibited any excavation without a special royal permission, and in case of discovery claims a right of purchasing any objects at their own valuation. What a stimulus to genius ! what an encouragement to enterprize ! He has a stimulus to genius ! what an encouragement to enterprize !

On the height beyond Giarre, towards the north, is the famous forest of chesnut trees, and the still more celebrated monarch of that woody,sphere the Castagno di Cento Cavalli; for the purpose of seeing which we deviated from the direct path and rejoined the grand sentier at the river Camarello, or, as it is usually called, Fiume Freddo, thus prolonging the usual day\u2019s journey nearly five miles. Nothing can be more beautiful, more luxuriant, or more picturesque, than the chesnut trees of Mascali Vecchio; many of them measure from forty to sixty feet in circum\u00ac ference, with the most grotesque formed ramifications fea\u00ac thering to the ground, almost enveloped in an exuberance of rich foliage. The large one abovementioned, called the Cento Cavalli,\" received its appellation from one of the queens of Arragon, on a visit to the mountain, having, with all her suite of horsemen, taken shelter, during a storm, within the circumference of its decayed spreading trunk : it is composed of five separated stems, standing in a circle, measuring one hundred and seventy feet round, each of which is hollowed to the core, and, being without bark on the inner side, are asserted to have been originally united into one large trunk : however, the assumption is preposte\u00ac rous; they are all evidently of different growth, the roots of which may be distinctly traced radiating from each through the great circle, which could not be the case if belonging to one parent stem. The whole forms a beau- tiful sheltered retreat; a public path leads through it, and a hut stands in the centre for the use of the people who a hut stands in the centre for the use of the people who gather the chesnuts in the season.

It was that period called the Novena, or the nine days before the nati\u00ac vity, established by the Roman catholic church for the exercise of certain devotions and religious ceremonies ap- propriated to the holy virgin, and which is celebrated in Sicily with the most fervent piety. The multiplied statues of the Virgin, enshrined in the numerous niches of every street, were brilliantly lighted up by nine immense wax candles, emblematic of the anni\u00ac versary, before each of which were seen prostrate groups of women and children offering up their idolatrous worship, of women and children offering up their idolatrous worship, accompanied with groans, digital crossings, and the count\u00ac ing of beads. In front of some, parties of the Calabrian pfifereri stood exercising their discordant energies in the service of devotion ; at others, two or three harpers ac\u00ac companied the pious offerings of the religious enthusiasts with the more soothing and inspiring harmony of their in\u00ac struments; whilst in two or three parts of the city, excel\u00ac lent bands of music poured forth the most fascinating and melodious strains before some of the more favoured and most popular idols, which, decked out in all the gaudy splendour of superstitious bigotry, seemed to excite the universal enthusiasm of all classes.
