The authoress hopes, however, that upon perusal, her letters will not be found a repe- tition of what has been written by others. During a residence in Italy of three years and a-half, she wrote constantly letters to her relations, and kept notes of all she saw. Upon her return to England, she was re- quested to publish, and has selected a period of four months in 1854, as that most likely to be of general interest. Few English visit the Eternal City in the summer; they are the Eternal City in the summer; they are consequently unacquainted with what is then going on. Tourists are usually too hurried to bestow much time upon Perugia and Siena, to bestow much time upon Perugia and Siena, both of which are well worth long visits.                   ",

This day, however, the sun shone brightly, and the grand old prophets and sibyls stood and the grand old prophets and sibyls stood forth in majesty. The congregation was very small; within the grating were some few Romans, and several monks of religious orders, particularly Dominicans. In the ladies\u2019 department were only five besides our- selves.

This (called a hearse in early Eng- lish history) was covered with black cloth, and made in the form of a gigantic urn, with cover and pedestal. It was tastefully adorned with strips of gold cloth, surrounded by lighted candles, and on the highest point was the papal tiara.

I ought not to call Perugia exactly his native city, for he was born at Citt\u00e0 della Pi\u00e9ve, about twenty-eight miles off, in the year 1446. When very young, his father brought him to Perugia, and placed him under the care of Buonfigli. The young painter had the most ardent loye for his adopted city (whence his name Perugino), and never could bear to be long absent from it, always returning there with great delight both from Rome, where he went twice to paint for the Sistine Chapel, and from Florence, where he went frequently, but never would settle there, notwithstanding great solicitations. He continued his art to the last ; a picture of his, painted at the age the last ; a picture of his, painted at the age of seventy-two, is preserved with great care. In 1524, he died of the plague, at Fontig- nano, half-way between Citt\u00e0 della Pi\u00e9ve and Perugia. As he surpassed his master, so in his turn he had to yield to his pupil Rafael, whose early paintings resemble Pietro\u2019s greatly. I am told that Vasari makes Pietro to have been an unbeliever, but this was not the case. Indeed all his works bear the marks of the Christian.

Our road lay through fertile plains, richly cultivated. The grapes were beginning to acquire a purple hue, and seemed better than last year. The Gran Turco,\" or Indian corn, looked excel- lent, and the fields waving with it were still green.

This lady was an inhabitant of Ischia, who took the veil at an early age in a convent of Naples. It does not appear that she ever regretted the step she had taken, but her health suffered greatly. She was permitted to return to her native air for six months: and when her health was restored she returned again to Naples, where she fell ill imme- diately.

On one side rose the dark stem Cape of the Emperor, with a foreground of the brightest gold and crimson; on the other lay the lovely Bays of Zara and St. Montano. Our ride home was surpassingly beautiful. Ischia has put on her brightest mantle this my last evening. Naples, Sept. 14. I was up early yesterday, packing, paying bills, saying good-bye, &amp;c. Elisabetta wept much at parting with me ; so, to console her, 1 invited her to visit me at Naples by-and-by. At twelve I mounted my donkey, said adieu to Lacco, and went to the Sentinella Grande. I dined with my friends, and sat out with them in their arbour, commanding a most extensive and lovely prospect. Mr. R\u2014 derives such benefit from drinking some waters of Casamicciola and taking the * stufe\" of St. Lorenzo, that he remains here with the ladies a fortnight longer. Mr. B- took Gurgitello baths for sciatica, and they have He returned to Naples done him great harm. with me. At three o\u2019clock we rode down to the Marina, and embarked in the Golfo di Napoli steamer. We went entirely round the island of Procida, which I was glad to have an opportunity of see- ing. It is very long and narrow, being seven miles in circumference and not more than half a mile wide. The town is large and thickly a mile wide. The town is large and thickly peopled; the island is said to contain nearly 10,000 inhabitants: it probably was once a part of Ischia, and separated from it by volcanic agency. The men are the best sailors and fishermen in the kingdom. Till lately the Greek costume was kept up here, but now the women have adopted the dress of the Ischiotes. There are several small hamlets on Procida as well as the principal town. At six o\u2019clock we were safely anchored in the                                         ",

My two months at Ischia are now over, and I can thoroughly recommend the island as exqui- sitely beautiful, and affording a delightful summer retreat ; but I would strongly warn every one not to meddle with the waters without very competent medical advice. Baths of acqua del occhio could not do any one harm, but the stronger waters might, unless properly applied. The bathing sea- son is from June to the end of September, when the rain which usually falls weakens the effect of the waters. A guide to the island has been published by Dr. Rivaz, and may be had at any bookseller\u2019s in Naples. The day I left Lacco the thermometer was 78\u00b0, and will now continue to fall. I have now seen most of the islands of the neighbourhood, and greatly prefer Ischia to all others. Mr. B\u2014 who has been much in Egypt and the East, says he has never seen so much beauty in so small a space as in Ischia: you may have scenery of all kinds. 1 have not ex- plored the part of the island beyond the town did, and said it was of Ischia; but Miss O\u2014 fertile, but not nearly so beautiful as Casamicciola and Lacco.
