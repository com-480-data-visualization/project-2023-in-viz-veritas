Above the plain which forms the summit of that mountain rise glaciers whence issue several streams. On the northern declivity, the Saltine in the middle of its course receives the Ganther; it then takes a northern direction and discharges itself into the Rhone near Brieg.  A league farther, on the south side, the Krumbach and the Laquina by their junction form the Doveria. This river, after running first to the east along the deep valley of Gondo, and then to the south, falls, near Domo d\u2019Ossola, into the Toccia, which at the distance of six leagues enters Lago Maggiore. The valleys scooped out by these different streams facilitated the plan of the road which has been constructed over the mountains that inclose them. The length of this road from Brieg to Domo d'Ossola is thirteen leagues and a half. Till the beginning of the present century, a narrow and dangerous track, running almost at random among the wild rocks and valleys of the Simplon, was the only passage for muleteers and the few travellers whom necessity conducted                           ",

And vet the road of the Simplon, originating in the most selfish policy, as strongly attests his unprincipled ambition and his insatiable thirst of universal dominion, as the invasion of Spain and the ashes of Moscow. The works of this road were commenced in 1801. M. Ceard, the author of the plan, was the engineer appointed to superintend and direct them. Imagination can scarcely figure to itself the obstacles that opposed the execution of this undertaking. It was not only required that the road should be twenty four feet wide in every part, and have an inclina- tion not exceeding six inches in each fathom, that it should cross rivers and precipices and perforate the heart of rocks; but in many places it was to rest upon crags undermined by time and torrents: it was necessary to support and consolidate these ancient mountains and to erect upon their sides massive walls, resembling ramparts, one hundred feet high.

From Brieg to Domo d'Ossola, the road, as smooth as the walk of a garden, is carried among rocks, precipices and torrents, winding in graceful sweeps to follow the undulations and slopes of the mountains, imperceptibly rising to the elevation of 4,014 feet above Gliss, and again descending 5,255 feet to Domo d'Os- sola. In this distance it passes over twenty two bridges and through seven galleries of sufficient width to admit three car- riages abreast: the principal of these galleries, nearly seven hundred feet in length, is cut out of a solid rock of granite. Th\u00e8re is scarcely any pass over lofty mountains which Nature has not surrounded with interesting scenery. The scholar, the artist, or the traveller conducted thither by mere curiosity, all find inexhaustible subjects for study and admi\u00ac ration. The wild appearance of those enormous masses, the rocks, the forests, and the everlasting ice with which they are crowned, the torrents tumbling in cascades with a roar that interrupts the profound silence of the valleys\u2014form altogether \u00e0 scene of grandeur that varies at every step, and produces sensations to which the freshness and purity of the air give increased intensity.

But besides this regular increase. the lake is sometimes observed to rise all at once four or five feet, and then to fall with equal rapidity. This species of tide lasts for some hours. The hypothesis which most rationally accounts for these effects, ascribes them to partial variations in the pressure of the atmosphere. The same phenomenon has been remarked in all the other lakes of Switzerland. The depth of the lake has been found to differ much in differ\u00ac ent places. Near Geneva it is very shallow, owing to a bank of mud and sand ; whereas opposite to the rocks of Meillerie, the plummet has indicated a depth of 950 feet: which according to the remark of De Saussure, corroborates the opinion of those the remark of De Saussure, corroborates the opinion of those philosophers, who think that, in lakes as in the sea, the deepest parts are found facing the highest cliffs on their shores, The water of the lake is perfectly clear and transparent through- out its whole extent, excepting near the mouth of the Rhone; out its whole extent, excepting near the mouth of the Rhone; there the river discharges its waves impregnated with matter which it carries along in its impetuous course ; but when it has proceeded to a certain distance in the lake, its motion becomes slower; the mud which it held in solution sinks to the bottom, where it remains till some violent wind drives it to the shore. In this manner, the lands situated near the mouth of the Rhone re\u00ac ceive annual accessions, encroach upon the lake, and form marshes, which are by degrees converted into fertile fields. This encroachment of the shore is considerable enough to be perceived by each generation. Strangers are shown a village named Pre- vallay (Portus Valesia), which formerly stood on the brink of the lake, and is now a mile and a half from it.

The lake contains 29 species of fish, among which are salmon trout som\u00e9times weighing from 40 to 60 pounds, and carp of 30 pounds. It is frequented by 49 species of birds ; and the coluber berus, an extremely venomous kind of viper, is met with on the cliffs of Meillerie and of the Ryfshal, between Lausanne and Vevay.

Before the incorporation of Savoy and Geneva with France, the banks of the lake formed the boundaries of five different states; namely, France, the Chablais (a province of Savoy), the Valais, the republic of Geneva, and the Pays de Vaud, a dependency of the canton of Berne. The latter is the richest, the most populous, the canton of Berne. The latter is the richest, the most populous, and the best cultivated tract ; it contains two vineyards, which produce white wines that are highly esteemed.

On these rapid declivities, covered with earth brought from other places, the industrious inhabitants have found means to naturalize the vine, and to make it produce abundant crops. In the vicinity of Geneva, the wine is of mid\u00ac dling quality. At the foot of the mountains of Chablais, which have \u00e0 northern aspect, the climate is not warm enough to per\u00ac mit the cultivation of the vine; nay, even corn will scarcely ripen there in cold, wet years; but, on the other hand, the pasturage is excellent. Ir we except Geneva, where commerce and manufactures have always fiourished, very little traffic is carried on in most of the towns around the lake, though they are favourably situated for trade. The construction of the magnificent roads of the Simplon, Mont Cenis, and La Faucille, all of which terminate on the shores of the lake, may perhaps contribute to change this state of things. The advantages afforded by them would be greatly increased, if the plan so frequenty canvassed of rendering the Rhone navigable from Seyssel to Geneva were to be carried into execution. Cologni, a village situated on the southern shore of the lake. and on the road to the Simplon, is one of the points from which Geneva appears to greatest advantage. The city rising amphi theatrically at the extremity of the lake, the Rhone which runs through it, the smiling hill by which it is overloked, the hand- some villas that suround it, and the liquid expanse in which most of these objects are resteted, form altogether a remarkable view.

From the 13th century these prelates were engaged in incessant quarrels with the Counts of the Genevois and the Counts of Savoy, for the possession of the city ; and from the middle of the 15th century to 1536 its inhabitants had to maintain a con- stant struggle against the ambition of the Dukes of Savoy, till by their own valour and the aid of the Swiss confederation they acquired perfect liberty and independence. In 1530, Farel, Fro\u00ac ment, Lambert and Bousquet began to exhort the Genevese to shake off the yoke of the priests, and with the active co-operation of Calvin, the Reformation was introduced in 1535. Calvin was not only the reformer but also the legislator of this republic. Clemens, Marot, and Theodore Beza from France, soon after- wards sought an asylum at Geneva, where they translated the Psalms into verse, which Calvin had set to music and printed at Lyons, and introduced them into the churches of Geneva. The Reformation drew hither many proselytes from Languedoc, Poi\u00ac tou, Lucca, the vicinity of Vicenza, and even from the Greek island of Candia.

A livid complexion, flaccid flesh, and pendent lips are the external symptoms of the disease: several cretins, denied both speech and hearing, are strangers to every other sensation than that of satisfying the first wants of nature.

The Valaisan exports some raw productions, but no manufactured articles: indeed he scarcely knows how to convert his wool and flax into the coarse stuffs in which the lower classes are clothed. The road which now traverses the Valais will perhaps impart increased activity to agriculture, and give birth to some manufactures: but these advantages, splendid as they may appear, would be too dearly bought, if they cost these they may appear, would be too dearly bought, if they cost these people the simplicity of their manners and the happy obscurity in which they have so long lived.

In the following year the Duke of Savoy and Bishop of Geneva invaded the Upper Valais with 10,000 men, for the purpose of attacking on all sides the confederates, who were then at war with the Duke of Burgundy and the Count de Romont, the sovereign of the Pays de Vaud. The people of the Valais and of Berne flew to arms, and 7,000 of them hastened across the Sanetoch to Sion where on the 13th November they routed the Savoyards with the loss of 1,300 men.

ONE of the most magnificent, and at the same time one of the most beautiful and extensive prospects is afforded to the traveller from the entrance to the gallery of Schalbet on the side of Italy: he here takes a review of the road he has passed, which of Italy: he here takes a review of the road he has passed, which is seen winding round the side of the mountain of L\u00e9ria; the old road is also visible, following the same direction, but less distinct and more circuitous. In the luxuriant and deep valley beyond, the smiling village of Naters forms an interesting object: it is surrounded by mea\u00ac dows of the freshest green, and encompassed by trees, some of handsome and ancient growth. The whole of the fore-ground is well wooded with pines and firs of various kinds; and the strong lines of the broken rocks and the dark foliage of the trees serve to set off the distance with great delicacy and effect. The valley is watered by the Rhone. Beyond Naters the mountains rise somewhat gradually, but picturesquely: they are broken by winter cataracts and other causes, in some places into very fantastic forms; and that which immediately backs the village is in parts richly ornamented by wood, principally firs, but the sameness of their effect is relieved by the distance from which they are seen. These are the moun- tains of the Valais, and beyond them, at a great distance, but rendered less in appearance to the eye by the magnitude and brightness of the objects, are the glaciers of Switzerland, and brightness of the objects, are the glaciers of Switzerland, extending through an enormous space on either hand. Upon the whole, this one of the finest and noblest views in the entire the whole, this one of the finest and noblest views in the entire range of country through which the traveller has to pass.

It is probable that this low diet for a man of a weakly constitution and leading a laborious life, wholly devoted to the relief of the poor and the service of religion, has- tened the end of the Cardinal. During a visitation which he was holding in his diocese, he was attacked with a violent fever, and had scarcely reached Milan before he expired at the age of forty six vears. The news of his death threw the whole city into mourning, and he was canonised by Pope Paul V. in 1605.  The memory of St. Charles is held in high respect in the north of Italy; a statue of him has been erected in one of the public squares of Milan, and his body is preserved in a subter\u00ac raneous chapel of the cathedral. Here it is exhibited in a case of crystal, dressed in the pontifical habit; the crosier is enriched with precious stones.

He will not fail also to visit the Ambrosian Library founded by Count Frederic Borromeo, who, like his illustrious relative, St. Charles, was dig\u00ac nified with the Roman purple and the archiepiscopal mitre of Milan. This collection contains one hundred and forty thousand printed volumes, and upwards of fifteen thousand manuscripts of all ages and in all languages, to which the researches and publi\u00ac all ages and in all languages, to which the researches and publi\u00ac cations of M. Ma\u00ef have recently attracted the attention of the learned. The celebrated picture of the Last Supper, by Leonardo da Vinci, decorated one of the walls of a Dominican convent, now suppressed, and the church of which is called S. Maria delle Grazie. The fate of this master-piece, upon which the painter was engaged sixteen years, has long been deeply regretted by alf lovers of the arts. Owing to the nature of the ground prepared for the reception of the colours, damp, neglect, and repairs by the hands of incompetent artists, no part of the original work of the hands of incompetent artists, no part of the original work of Da Vinci is now left, so that the whole exhibits but a lifeless re\u00ac semblance of the animated composition of that great master. All that vet remains of the ancient castle of Milan is the inter\u00ac nal square, which is used as barracks for troops. Theimpossibi\u00ac lity of sustaining a siege now preserves the city from those horrors to which it has been so often exposed; having been besieged                                  ",

It is intended for horse-races, combats of animals, and even naumachia, as the arena can be laid under water in a very short time. It would require a distinct work to furnish a guide to all that is remarkable in Milan.
