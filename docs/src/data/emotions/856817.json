Where- ever the strokes are deep and strong, you may be sure there is a blot. The Romans are a sullen, pale, spiritless, morose people. They hardly ever speak, except to beg alms, which when offered they absolutely tear from the giver, with\u00ac out taking the trouble to thank him for them, and without showing the least satis- faction at having obtained them. They are not at all like the Italians we had pre- viously seen ; in fact, they are like no other living beings. The whole nation seems tired of its existence, and waiting for the sleep of death. Walking, seeing, hearing,\u2014every act in short seems to be a painful exertion of exhausted mind and body.

Yet is there something in the sulky inso- lence of the Romans,\u2014in their morose, ill\u00ac natured looks,\u2014that puts one strongly in mind of what they were in the days of their prosperity. Their manner is like the growl- ing of an old mastiff, conscious at once of his former strength, and of the loss of his teeth. It is this galling sense of their im\u00ac potence which makes them such dangerous enemies ; they brood over their injuries with a degree of malice of which they would not be capable, if they thought they could \u00e9asily revenge them; and as they are pos- sessed of few ideas, that one passion which happens to take full possession of their minds festers sooner or later into a crime.

Madame de Stael was one of the best, as well as one of the mostextraordinary women that ever existed ; her imperfections were such as could injure none but herself ; they were the failings of a noble, affection- ate, and unsuspecting heart. She never imagined that she had done wrong till she was made aware of it by others, and even then she was often unable to comprehend why that which she had done was wrong; for, strange as it may seem to those who only judge her from her last works, she was really in many respects a child to the end of her days.

In fact, the old chronicles and annals, some of which are supposed to have been written very near the times of which they treat, contained nothing that could lead moderns to suspect a con\u00ac nexion between these two princes (who were considered as intruders) and the family whose possessions they held. This may seem a matter of little mo\u00ac ment to those who look contemptuously on the history of a small country; but on the history of a small country; but the mode of succession adopted by the Lombards cannot be indifferent to those who look for something more than battles and slaughter, in the annals of great nations.
