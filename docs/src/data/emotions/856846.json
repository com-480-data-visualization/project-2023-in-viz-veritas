If the truth has obliged me to make any remarks on this subject, which put the state of brigandage under the present Government in somewhat unfavourable contrast with what it was under the Bourbons, it must not be thought on that account that I am at all inclined to favour the latter. From the bottom of my heart I wish well to United Italy; but for all that, while fully appreciating the difficulties of the new Government, I must not seek to conceal its shortcomings in dealing with the dreadful scourge which deprives the glorious peninsula of half its charms.
