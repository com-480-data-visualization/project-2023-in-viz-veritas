HIS book is more particularly a description, with black and white drawings and twenty-four paintings, of the country and of the life of the peasants in the of the country and of the life of the peasants in the little-known Italian provinces of the Abruzzi in the Central Apennines, as they were immediately before the War. I have tried to give an account, as faithful as possible, of the life and landscape as a setting for the popular customs the life and landscape as a setting for the popular customs and beliefs and something of the past local history. Few and beliefs and something of the past local history. Few travellers go to the Abruzzi, for they are wild in every sense of the word. Before setting out in company with my father I was warned that it was \"not safe, and those who, as I found afterwards, did not know the district, assured me that it was \u201call brigands, but I hope that the contents of my book will show that, however primitive and at times emotional the peasants may be, true kindli- ness, and not seldom unusual courtesy, are shown to sympathetic strangers. Priests and peasants alike did all that they could to make us both comfortable, and went out of their way constantly to find for us those who could tell us the local traditions and practices. When we visited a village, perhaps only for a few hours, it was our practice to see first of all the priest, who would generally show and tell us everything which he could think of as likely to interest us. Foreigners are almost unknown to the peasants, especially in the mountains, and anyone the peasants, especially in the mountains, and anyone painting local scenes and people, and really anxious to learn all they could about them, aroused great interest and received a hearty welcome.

Thave spelt and accented Italian words to show as clearly as I could the peculiarities of the local dialect, and I have made the translations of songs and stories as literal as possible. Thave often found it difficult to follow the original exactly, and yet be intelligible, and the English rendering may, therefore, seem a little crude, but I think that its literalness will give a true impression of the atmosphere and na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the original. Changes following every- where the War of 1914-1918 are affecting the Abruzzi also, so that I hope that there is some value in a faithful record with pen and brush of the survivals in this region of much of picturesque medi\u00e6val Italy, and even of a more remote and glorious Roman past. Such sur\u00ac vivals cannot but have absorbing interest both for the historian, the simple lover of the past, and the scientific student of folklore, besides every Italian. Thave many friends in Italy to thank. Owing to the War it has been impossible to keep in touch with them, or to get more of the material which they promised. Some were killed, others died of disease, and others again lost their lives in the great earthquake of 1915. During that year 1 received letters describing the peasants as homeless and out in thousands on the mountain side. They were and out in thousands on the mountain side.

He greeted us by asking what we wanted in a voice with a queer intonation of its own. There was one small cart with a brown canopy, and into this he bundled us and our boxes and then returned to his occupation of leaning against the wall on one leg. Our horse had red tassels, metal horns, and badger\u2019s hair hung to its harness to keep away the evil eye, and a large biga (rein holder) covered with tin and hung with bells glittered in the sun beating down on the white road which led up the hill from the station to the town. We sat under the brown canopy, and the driver under a blue umbrella. We passed an almond orchard, the delicate green foliage casting soft shadows on the browny yellow earth, and white walls beyond gleaming between the tree trunks. Groups of women and children went by carrying large copper conche (water-pots) on their heads. Then we came into the shade of the plane-tree avenue leading straight into Aquila itself. It had been a market day, and baskets of tomatoes, capsicums, and fruit were scattered round the narrow piazza. There were two fountains, one at each end, and women continually coming and going with conche full of water on their heads, whilst other women and children with large gold and enamel earrings chattered and bargained.

From the doorways all round came the clang of the beating of copper, for everywhere there the clang of the beating of copper, for everywhere there are coppersmiths, and huge cauldrons and conche gleamed out of the darkness of the dwellings. The houses are irregularly built, at all levels, with ancient stone carvings over their doorways, and in the interiors immense open fireplaces. In the trough in the piazza into which the water flows from the ninety-nine spouts on one of the two fountains, most of the washing is done, and the clothes are carried away on the women's heads. Everything is carried upon the head, from a cake of soap, knitting needles, and wool to a large iron bedstead, or planks and stones. The women and children first roll a handkerchief or a piece of cloth into a flat pad, which they place on their head, and then put their soap, or bedstead, on top of it. They have no need to touch it, for their balance is perfect, and they never let anything fall. They go up and down and they never let anything fall.

It was during a fight between Aquila and Rieti that the Rietini succeeded in carrying away from Aquila bell and a marble lion. This bell was placed on a tower and called the aquilanella (small eagle) as \u00e0 joke against the people of Aquila.

After my day\u2019s painting we used to go for a tramp through the village and into the country. Over one house there was the large stone carving of which there is \u00e0 drawing on page 41. In many places in Italy it is a common practice to put a charduse (a large thistle which grows close to the ground and generally has only one blossom) over the door to keep away witches. Here, however, the whole thing was carved in stone with the addition of a face in the disc. In Aquila I had noticed many houses which had the carving of the disc and rays over the doorways; some also had the eyes, nose, and mouth, others were simply a circle, and others again had the Christian I.H.S. in the middle, but this was the only the Christian I.H.S. in the middle, but this was the only one with the suggestion of the thistle leaves as well. No one could or would tell me what it meant, whether it was the symbol of the sun, or why it was there, and they was the symbol of the sun, or why it was there, and they all smiled when I asked. None of the other houses had anything of the kind. I suspected that it was to keep witches from entering the house, for in North Italy the charduse is believed to do so and is put over the door, The peasants told me that Castel del Sangro (Chap. xvi) witches, who are both male and female, come into the houses through the keyholes to suck the babies' blood, the houses through the keyholes to suck the babies' blood, after greasing themselves all over.

Sometimes witches take the form of cats and dogs, and are placed in a sack and beaten for punishment, after which they have to pass through a ring of the fireplace chain. Then they can only become free by begging for pity in the name of S. Ciovanni, and the woman who undoes th\u00e9 spell is reverenced. On Christmas Eve pigs\u2019 blood can be used to discover witches. These queer beings terrify the peasants. Even in church they do not feel safe from them. To prevent their escape, three pins are put in the Holy Water (Atri; Ortona), or a knife is planted in the ground (Rocaraso). The witch can then only leave the church by saluting and giving both hands to the man whom he has harmed, and giving both hands to the man whom he has harmed, calling him compare (partner) and promising to do him no more harm for seven generations.

When they stand, they nearly always remain more or less circular groups, with their heads together almost touching the ground. When they lie down, they are generally in one large group. Some of the shepherds are their own masters, but others are sent from the Roman Campagna by their owners during the summer, and only go down to the plains in the winter months. Their masters give the shepherds the winter months. Their masters give the shepherds rye or rice, oil, and a share of the sheep's cheese and milk produced. Each shepherd has a certain number of sheep and dogs, with large iron collars studded with spikes, to protect them from wolves. Before the sheep are shorn they are thrown into a small square pond and are shorn they are thrown into a small square pond and shaken, to wash them. They have big bells. When fine the shepherds wear their leather coats with a sheep- skin lining inside, but when wet the wool is put outwards. Inside the shelters are one or two scraps of blanket, a bag of rice, and oil. The two latter, with cheese made from sheep's milk, and the milk itself, are the usual food of the shepherds.

One player begins by throwing a peg towards his companion with his left hand, and the other must hit back with his stick, replacing the stick in the ditch; then the first player must send back the peg in the same way and so on. When a player fails he pays a fine to the other player, and the player who pays the most fines is naturally the loser.

Some years after, the same old man went to Ancona for the feast of S. Ciriaco. At the palace window he saw a beautiful girl, who was blind in one eye. Directly she saw him she came into the street, welcomed him affectionately, asked him in, and treated him most him affectionately, asked him in, and treated him most sumptuously. To the old man all this seemed as a dream which he could not explain, but the girl told him she had been the serpent which he had saved from stoning, and, although she had lost one eye, he had saved her life and thereby also enabled her to resume human form and return home. Another story told how once on S. Pietro\u2019s day a boat put out fishing and met a waterspout. One fisherman tried to cut it with his knife, but was not quick enough, and the boat capsized ; only a few of the fishermen were saved. Among these was the man who had tried to dispel the waterspout.

From where 1 was painting I could see range beyond range of mountains with the castle villages on their crest and the valley beneath, where the peasants were cutting and ploughing one or two fields, and the threshing floors on the opposite side of the hill looked like so many pennies put side by side and surrounded with stones. The peasants loaded their mules with sacks of corn, and at that distance they appeared like ants creeping along. at that distance they appeared like ants creeping along. They wound their way down the tracks, were lost to view, and finally came along the path where I was sitting, followed by peasants and children who continually shouted \"Ah!

We could not see any sheep in the plain; they all seemed to have been taken to pasture on the hills, and, as we had a long way to return and a bad storm was blowing up, we remounted and set out homewards.

Antonio Abate (17th January), decorated sledges drawn by oxen and laden with big logs of wood are taken round by the peasants, and the wood distributed amongst the convents. After a good meal they all return in a procession, and then a peasant dresses up as S. Antonio and sings his adventures and also descriptions of the local incidents of his life in a humorous and ingratiating style. Another peasant repre- sents an angel, and a third the Devil; they knock at the doors of the principal houses, enter, and then S. Antonio sings his part, while the angel and Devil try to conceal themselves. There is then a feast of wine, chicken, sausages, and other good things. The following day there are big dinners, and thus the Carnival is opened. The old man on the wall sang with hesitation. He kept stopping and saying he could not go on, but the archiprete and children, who had come to see us off, encouraged him, and we managed to get the song.

My horse sniffed the air and dipped down into a cornfield to get some mouthfuls of grain, and this he tried to do several times, but I made him content himself with snatching at a few stray overhanging ears by the path. He knew quite well that our tall athletic- looking guide with his coffee-coloured complexion and his large sombrero hat drawn down over his black eyes was looking at him to see that he behaved. We still went up, finding it was not quite so steep, but there were no more cornfields, and again we went through loose stones. Our animals were very sure-footed ; the mules never stumbled and it was only now and then that the horse half-stumbled and then, to keep his balance, just slid with the falling stones. Our guide told us that these horses, born and bred in the mountains, are almost as sure-footed as the mules, the one disadvantage being that they never \"smell a precipice when they are nearing it, like a mule who, a precipice when they are nearing it, like a mule who, however quickly he may be going, even if he is running away, will draw up at the edge of the precipice, whereas a horse plunges down it straightaway without realising it is there.

Francesco's convent lived in peace and prosperity until a certain old woman came to it. At first they refused her admission, but she so insisted and appealed to their feelings that last they accepted her as a cook. Little by little she persuaded them to give up one fast after another until all were given up. It was the same with the Confession and all other religious practises, and the convent, which used to be very rich, possessing one thousand cows, became poor and was reduced to only one hundred cows.

Every day he returned to the church and prayed for his one hundred cows in return for the one given away. One morning he found -Go to the convent of S. Francesco, show a note saying, a note saying, this note, and your wish will be fulfilled. He went, and presented the note to the gatekeeper, who on reading it found the following,\u2014 Let all and everything be blessed in the convent.

The friars went in procession and blessed all the stables, cellars, cells, and passages, and at last reached the kitchen.

So far as I can gather, it is a mediaeval book of magic, which is still passed in secret through the mountains both in north and south Italy.

The riders therefore alighted, tied the horses to the trees, and walked the rest of the way. They reached their homes, entered un- observed, and in the night they saw their wives without being able to touch them. After this they rode back.

Some shepherds asked him to do this, but Scaramella said that if he did the wolves would come and eat their sheep. On their insisting, he called the wolves, which came, and killed the sheep during the night while the shepherds were asleep. The shepherds, infuriated, tried to kill Scaramella with their heavy sticks, and he was obliged to run for hislife. Another time, when burning his charcoal, he again called the wolves, and told his friends how many would come. He hid in the trunk of a tree where he was wont to sleep, and the wolves came. After counting them, he lit a fire to send them away, but one remained, his tail caught in the trunk of the tree. From inside the tree Scaramella pulled its tail, shouting at each pull. To extricate itself, the wolf pulled all the more. After a fierce struggle the wolf gave a sharp pull and ran away, leaving its tail behind. The wolf became more and more mischievous, and the shepherds determined to kill it, but it left the mountains, went down into the plains of Teramo, and did so much damage that everyone was in despair. In the summer, Scaramella went to the Teramese to reap, and he promised to expel the wolf. Everyone laughed, but one night he slept where the wolf had been. As usual it came, jumped into the middle of the sheepfold, and Scaramella called out,\u2014 Ci vogliamo riessere'' (we want to pull). The wolf became so frightened that it fled, and next morning was found dead. The Teramesi carried Scaramella in triumph to Castel del Monte, giving him seven asses laden with corn, chickens, and other presents.

Giovanna Petroni had lost several children, and, as we were worried about her last baby, who was ailing and we were worried about her last baby, who was ailing and becoming very thin, we wondered what we should do, said Morica. Finally we decided that a certain witch was sucking it, and we asked Alessandro, a bricklayer, who was suspected of being a stregone (wizard), if he would go to see her. He went, telling her he knew how to cure her child. Giovanna had no money, but agreed to give him twenty yards of hemp cloth (forotella). The bargain was concluded, the cloth handed over, and Alessandro made a breve* for the baby, put it round its neck and assured the mother that the baby would recover, but it would be necessary also to keep the witch out of the way. To do so, at midnight she must undo the fascie (swathings) of the baby, because the witch was hidden in it, stretch them out on the floor, and cut them into pieces with a hatchet. This was done. During the night many hard strokes of the hatchet were heard on the floor where the fascie had been spread. Next day, Pugliesa, who also had the reputation of being a witch, went to the mother, saying she was in great pain because during the night she had received many strokes on her back. Giovanna Petroni rejoiced in her deed of the previous night, but marvelled greatly that the woman Pugliesa was still alive after so many strokes of the hatchet on her spine. To get rid of her she gave her a pot of lard, and all else that she had, telling her story to everyone. But, notwith- standing this, the baby died. This was in 1870.

Wherever one turned there were archways, galleries, steps, mouldings, and windows. Finally I decided on the alley with the steps, partly because we could not stay very long and it was fairly simple, and partly because in doing it I could sit on a flight of steps out of reach of the clamouring peasants and, Thoped, also of the fleas. Before beginning we looked at the church, by the other alley which surrounded the village. It was queer and uneven, built by the side of a rock, and it had corners, angles, and pillars in all sorts of unexpected places. At the uneven end of the church, in a recess which faced west, there was a very elaborate high altar covered with gold. It had carved pillars, flowers, and leaves all gilded, and was very fantastic and quite in keeping with the queer place. To the left there was another large altar much in the same style but not quite so rich, and there were lustre candelabra and curious painted wooden chandeliers.

In olden days there were two distinct villages facing each other on opposite hills. One was called Ate, and the other Tixa. Both villages were in despair because of the dragon living in the valley which divided them. This beast devoured all travellers, besides daily exacting human flesh from each of the villages. When the Bishop, San Leucio, came to Ate, the bells of both villages rang of their own accord, and the inhabitants knew he was a saint, and knelt and prayed him to free them from the                                   ",

San Leucio became the patron saint of the village, and the dragon's rib is there to this day. The two populations gradually filled the valley, and the two villages of Ate and Tixa became Atixa, now the modern Atessa. At Fara S.

Then a fata appeared and gave him a talisman, saying,\u2014With this thou canst have what thou wantest, even the king's thou canst have what thou wantest, even the king's daughter. The young man took the talisman, and asked the girl,\u2014 Wilt thou marry me?\" She at first did not want to do so, but in the end, through the power of the talisman, she could not resist. The two young people, in fear of punishment for having come out of the towers unknown to their fathers, ran away. They travelled and travelled, always content and happy. One evening they arrived at the cottage of a well-to-do peasant who was on the point of dying. They looked after him, and, before dying, the peasant said to the young man,\u2014After my death thou must dig the orchard under the fig-tree, and                                 ",

While he was taking it, the talisman fell from his breast, and a white bird picked it up, and flew away. The young man followed that day and the next, without being able to catch it. In despair he returned to where he had left his bride, but she, thinking herself bereaved, had gone. Notwithstanding his grief, the bridegroom did not give up his hope. If he his grief, the bridegroom did not give up his hope. If he could only recover the talisman, everything would be right again. At that moment the white bird came and it let the talisman fall. The husband picked it up, and put it in his breast, and ordered it to make him find his bride. it in his breast, and ordered it to make him find his bride. Meanwhile he put into the bottom of several baskets the money he had found with the treasure. To hide it, he covered it with fresh olives and dry figs; then he packed it on to several mules. He travelled over mountains and valleys, always in search of his beloved, the talisman as his guiding star. At a great palace he asked for and obtained lodging. He unloaded the mules, and hid the talisman in one of the baskets, to prevent it from being lost or stolen during the night. He then went to sleep with the ser- vants. The mistress of the house, who was a beautiful girl, for curiosity went to look through the baskets, and found the talisman. She was his lost bride, and on finding it she knew that, as it belonged to her bridegroom, this it she knew that, as it belonged to her bridegroom, this man must be he. In the morning, by virtue of the talis- man, they recognised each other. The two kings agreed to the marriage, and were especially pleased because the bridegroom had brought all the baskets full of money and every good gift of God.                                 ",

There was a background of mountains in a haze of light, the village standing out a tone darker in a haze of light, the village standing out a tone darker in front of them, but also bathed in light shining through the haze and the smoke which came from the houses.

She is going to be married, and she will steal the money and the linen. Tsaid,\u2014\" Thou canst not prevent her from being married. Let her go.\u201c \"Help me to shoot her before she leaves at six to-morrow morning. Stop her in the fields when she is on her way to the posta, and I will shoot. Vengeance is the most beautiful thing, says one of our proverbs, and I will be revenged.\" I was naturally somewhat taken I will be revenged.\" I was naturally somewhat taken aback at this demand, and I talked of other things. Just before sunset the beautiful sister came and asked me to go for a walk with her, saying she wished to talk to me.                                    ",

I told her to speak the truth for once in her life, if she knew what truth meant. She begged me to tell her if she knew what truth meant.

They were built of such immense stones that no one knows how it was possible to get them there and build them together. The tradition is that they are \"Mura Ciclopiche, 1.e. walls built by the cyclops, though some say it was the Etruci (Etruscans). Half a mile from the village, on a mountain called La Praja, there are also remains of cyclopean walls, and it was the custom on the eve of the festa of San Giovanni Battista (S. John Baptist) to ascend this mountain during the night and be ready to see the sun rise and make three the night and be ready to see the sun rise and make three leaps.

NE day we went to see the little village of Cocullo, two hours' away by train from Sulmona. Just as we arrived we met a procession of pilgrims who had been on a four days' pilgrimage into the mountains, and on their return had been to visit the image of S. Domenico, the local patron saint who protects from tooth- ache, hydrophobia, and serpent bites. The pilgrims walked along two by two, and all the women had handker- chiefs of every shade of orange and green. They also had coce (shoes) (page 189), and each carried a terra-cotta pot or flask for water, sometimes in the shape of a large fish, and sometimes decorated with designs in relief. Each peasant woman must carry a burden, which is represented by bundles slung over their shoulders on sticks. These bundles were wrapped round with rags and contained a few provisions. Some of the women had staves. The bareheaded men also had their bundles.

The Archiprete Loreto Marchione told us that S. Domenico of Cocullo, or of Sora, was born at Foligno in Umbria, A.D. 950, and died at Sora, January 22nd, A.D. 1031. He was of the Order of S. Benedict, and founded several convents in the valleys and mountains of the Abruzzi, but he never remained in them. He used to assemble the monks, elect their chief, and then retire to live the life of an anchorite in a cavern. He founded a monastery at Cocullo, and stayed there some time, per\u00ac forming many miracles. When he left the people en- treated him to leave something of himself to protect them from misfortune, venomous serpents, hydrophobia, and toothache. He consented, and, as a gift, he pulled out one of his teeth, and presented it to the inhabitants, together with a shoe from his she-mule. With the mule-shoe the peasants used to brand their arms, as a preventive of toothache and hydrophobia from the bites of mad dogs. There are also small mule-shoes which are kept only as a devozione.

There are numerous local legends about the saint. S. Domenico also went to Scanno, and when he was riding Giulia, his she-mule, on his way back to Cocullo she lost one of her shoes. At Cocullo S. Domenico begged the village farrier to shoe Giulia for God's sake, for he had to leave next day, and had not a farthing. The blacksmith shod Giulia, but afterwards asked to be paid for so doing. S. Domenico, having nothing, entreated him to let him go, for God's sake. \"God's sake is no him to let him go, for God's sake. \"God's sake is no good to me, I want money !\" was the reply. S.

On the last day of Carnival, the Carnival figure is dressed as a shepherd in sheepskin and large hat, with a stick. The Easter figure is dressed in old worn-out clothes with a frying pan.
