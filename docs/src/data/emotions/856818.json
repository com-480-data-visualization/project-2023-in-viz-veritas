T had accordingly well-grounded apprehensions that my readers would expect some account of a revolution, at the period of my journey, not only far distant, but the con\u00ac templation of the occurrence of which, at any time, must then have been considered chimerical. I had consequently but slightly alluded to it, and that only in the part of my work written since the event; but now, when it is discovered that this interesting incident was only an affair of a few, and we are persuaded that the nation is only anxious to hail and retain the transalpine troops as deliverers, I feel more confident in my omissions, as well as less desirous to implore indulgence or deprecate criticism on their account; though with all the humility becoming to a first attempt I am far from deeming myself insensible to either.

The journey which I thus had commenced, being merely the result of the interest which a protracted residence of three years in the city of Naples and its immediate environs had naturally extended to all the remainder of the kingdom, I found myself neither limited with regard to time, nor bound to any particular mode of travelling, circumstances of which I did not always avail                    ",

It is probable that the Sebethis was never a very considerable river, and that its scanty springs were withdrawn, or forced into dif- ferent directions, by one of those physical convulsions to which this portion of Europe has ever been subject.

At Orsara, a small village between Bovino and Troja, the usual amusement of the boys on a feast day is to divide them\u00ac selves into two bands, one of which guards a little wooden cart filled with rubbish, representing the procaccio, while the other performs the more glorious part of the comitiva, which attacks it; and which, it is needless to add, always gains the victory. The most celebrated troop of this kind in our days was that of the Vardarelli, so named from their chief and his brothers, who for more than two years invested this province, and the borders of Basilicata and Abruzzo, and were supposed to have collected immense wealth. To trace the progress of a life like theirs would be a difficult, but not uninteresting task: by turns soldiers, deserters, partisans, and traitors\u2014by turns imprisoned, punished, penitent, restored to society, or relapsed into guilt-                              ",

The Emperor Frederic the Second espoused the cause of the exiled monarch, and granted to his retainers, among whom were several Teutonic knights of the orders of our Lady of Mount Sion, and St. Mary of Prussia, the jurisdiction and revenues of many religious establishments in his own domains. This abbey, which had been destroyed by an earth- quake the preceding year, was rebuilt from the ground, and richly endowed; the Archbishop of Sipontum, metropolitan of the diocese, laying the first stone, on the feast of the Ascension. When the order was suppressed, it was given to the minor fathers of the institute of St. Francis, after which it fell into what is called com- mendum, and finally was attached to the royal possessions on the abolition of monastic orders. The walls and outbuildings show that its extent was con\u00ac siderable; and the church, though small, is in a tolerable state of preservation.

Thus ended a calamity, which had kept the whole kingdom in a state of anxiety and alarm for nearly a year. The origin of it has never been satisfactorily ascertained, but was supposed to have been derived from some infected merchandize brought over in the summer of 1815, by two of the trading inhabit- ants of Noja, from the coast of Dalmatia, where the disorder was then raging. It was reported that soon after their return some very fine linen had been sold in the town at so low a price that it was suspected to have been smuggled; and one of these individuals, who was absent from Noja at the time the plague declared itself, stimulated by the wish of seeing his family, applied to the magis- trate of Bari for permission to return thither.

The Angevine princes continued this practice, and the above-mentioned Philip, on whom it had been thus conferred, transmitted it to his three sons, who successively possessed it, and dying without issue left it to their sister Margaret, who carried it as a dowry to her husband Francesco del Balzo, and was succeeded in it by her son Giacomo. It is to be noticed, that from Philip down to this Giacomo, all the several possessors of this principality bore the additional, but empty, title of Emperor of Constantinople, in right of Catherine, wife of that Philip, and daughter of Baldwin of Flanders, deposed Emperor of the East. The vicissitudes to which the kingdom was subject during the turbulent reigns of the princes of the line of Durazzo, which fol\u00ac lowed those of Robert and his daughter Joan, and the assistance frequently offered by several of the principal nobles to the foreign pretenders to the realm, afforded its legitimate rulers ample scope for the display of arbitrary rapacity under the semblance of casti- gation, and the domains of the disaffected barons were in this way frequently confiscated to the crown, or conferred on its more favoured adherents. Thus we find Francesco and Giacomo del Balzo deprived of the principality of Taranto, which was after- wards given to Raimondo, commonly called Ramondello Orsino, who by his marriage with Mary of Enghien, heiress of the county                              ",

The domestics shrunk back in amazement, which was only equalled by the counts horror, when, on a nearer investigation, he descried on one of the slender fingers an emerald ring.

It was said, that a portion of military belonging to two different corps (cavalry and infantry) quartered at Nola, about twelve miles from the capital, had deserted with arms, horses, and accoutrements, and had taken the road had deserted with arms, horses, and accoutrements, and had taken the road to Avellino; that some of their officers had willingly accompanied them, while others had been compelled so to do; while from among these last, one while others had been compelled so to do; while from among these last, one had contrived to escape and bring the intelligence.

The precautionary measures taken to strengthen and defend with cannon the Ponte della Maddalena, which forms the principal entrance of the city the Ponte della Maddalena, which forms the principal entrance of the city from the Salerno, or Calabrian road, contributed greatly to increase the general inquietude; and the non-arrival of the diligence and post from Apulia was not likely to allay this feeling. Still, though various reports succeeded each other with rapidity during the two following days (the 3d and 4th), no positive intelligence as to the nature of the danger seemed likely to be acquired.

The Captain General, therefore, and Don Luigi de Medici, Minister of Finance, seemed to divide, in nearly equal shares, that portion of odium, which in all political revulsions is sure to explode and overwhelm some of the individuals employed by the existing government; but it would be gross the individuals employed by the existing government; but it would be gross exaggeration to assert, that this was either general or violent. The Minister of Finance never quitted Naples, where he continued to reside in his own house, and soon after gave in his accounts to the new Cabinet: and although a considerable assemblage of persons repaired to General Nugent's residence on the 6th, and asked for him, they proceeded to no violence on being told he was absent; and were dissuaded from to no violence on being told he was absent; and were dissuaded from                                     ",

The nature and object of the revolution was now become manifest to all those who might have entertained doubts with regard to either; and the instruments which had assisted its progress, as well as the channels throuch which it had been directed, were no longer secret, The sect of the Carbonari, an association founded in imitation of Free\u00ac masonry, and which had been proscribed and persecuted with equal rigour by the usurping and legitimate Sovereigns, was avowedly the principal agent and operator of the changes which had been effected in the government. Its origin is not of remote date; and whatever may have been its ultimate tendency, there seems no doubt that it was originally established with a view of repelling the progress of French power and revolutionary principles. of repelling the progress of French power and revolutionary principles. The attainment of a constitution has, however, been the object of this society for some years past, and has, with much more appearance of pro\u00ac bability than the defence of the established religion, furnished motives for the proscription which it has encountered from two successive governments. Experience has shown that the mystery and caution attending the pro\u00ac pagation of any prohibited and persecuted association, increases the zeal and fervour of its proselytes; and the widely extended ramifications of the Car- bonari sect would be, if any were required, a fresh proof this truth. It is not going too far to assert, that least one half of the individuals composing the population of the kingdom of Naples were bound to serve and assist the population of the kingdom of Naples were bound to serve and assist each other by the most solemn vows, as well as by the consideration of their mutual interest: where the efforts of so powerful a confederation are directed towards an object of national advantage, it is scarcely possible that they should fail.

Without attempting to refute the palpable fallacy of so sweeping an accusation, the author merely observes, that the ceremonies attending the installation of every new member are stamped with the most religious and even superstitious colouring; that the formulas read in their meetings bear a similar character; that they have chosen for their patron a Saint\u201c, whose a similar character; that they have chosen for their patron a Saint\u201c, whose legend is particularized by more than ordinary portion of miraculous deeds; and that even the distinctive colours which they have selected, and which each member assumes on his initiation, are supposed to bear some mystic reference to their religious dogmas. These colours are red, blue, and black; differing in this last from the French tri-colour riband, with which they have been confounded.

The following Sunday (July 23) a public dinner was given at the Campo di Marzo, to all the armed forces then assembled at Naples, including the di Marzo, to all the armed forces then assembled at Naples, including the militias, previous to the return of the last to their respective homes. It will be recollected that the revolutionary movements which took place almost spontaneously throughout the kingdom of Naples were accompanied by demonstrations of a similar nature in the principality of Pontecorvo and the Duchy of Benevento: these two small states, though subject to the Pon- the Duchy of Benevento: these two small states, though subject to the Pon- tifical sway, may be considered, by their local position, as forming parts of the Neapolitan dominions. One is at a loss how to qualify the singular policy which could dictate the restoration of these petty principalities to their former rulers, when the restoration of these petty principalities to their former rulers, when equivalent indemnifications might undoubtedly have been offered more con\u00ac veniently situated on the confines of the mother-country, No possession can seem less desirable or ad rantageous than that of states situated at so remote a distance from the seat of government that they can \u00ab This corps was so well armed, disciplined, and accoutred, that it could not be distinguished, in outward appearance, from those of the line. in outward appearance, from those of the line.

The persevering pertinacity so peculiar to the Romish See, and which, as \u00e0 modern author observes, forms the distinctive character of a government composed of old men, has obtained the restoration of Benevento by every treaty of peace which has been signed by the Popes and Kings of Naples during the lapse of eight centuries: still, though submitted to a different code, and governed according to a different system, the inhabitants of Ponte- corvo and Benevento could not be debarred from all intercourse with those of the surrounding districts: and the fire which had thus been silently kindled was not likely to be extinguished by the inefficient hand of the vicar of pon- tifical authority. These two states openly threw off their allegiance to the Court of Rome, and declared their intention of abiding by the fortunes, and sharing the and declared their intention of abiding by the fortunes, and sharing the independence, of their neighbours; but the Vicar-General and the new Cabinet wisely disclaimed any wish to avail themselves of these friendly overtures, and even prohibited all Neapolitan subjects from taking any part in the proceedings, which might give umbrage to a power whose goodwill in the proceedings, which might give umbrage to a power whose goodwill and friendship they were anxious to maintain. Perhaps a similar show of forbearance with regard to Sicily, although the relative positions of the two countries have no analogy with those of Naples and Benevento, might have averted the schism which appears more than apprehended in that island. * Whenever it was deemed necessary to recruit the garrison of Benevento by the addition of a few men, their passage through the Neapolitan territory became the subject of a negotiation. of a few men, their passage through the Neapolitan territory became the subject of a negotiation. and formed the basis of a mutual agreement between the contracting powers.

It is a fact, that, as far back as the year 1814, the hope and firm resolution of establishing a constitution existed among the generals of Murat\u2019s army, who had agreed to make an effort for that purpose at that period.
