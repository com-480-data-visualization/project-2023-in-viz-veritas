## Dataset - Travel Guides from 1550 to 1930

The dataset we are working on is a collection of old travel guides for Italy from the rare books collection of the [Bibliotheca Hertziana](https://www.biblhertz.it/it/home) in Rome . 
The collection contains around 800 documents in several languages from the years 1550 up until 1930. 
They are sparsely illustrated and contain a lot of recognizable place names. 
All of them have been recently digitized, but only around 80 have also been transcribed using [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/?sc=Transkribus). Tranksribus is an AI supported platform for text recognition and transcriptions. 

We scraped the transcripts from Transkribus and obtained the metadata directly from the Bibliotheca Hertziana, which kindly provides us access to data that can be of interest for vizualisation. We have access to metadata like title and author, year and place of publication, language of the text, and several other columns that might be of lesser interest, such as format of the document. Since the texts are in several languages, one of the potential challenges is how to use NLP techniques on the text to extract for example place names and sentiment. 

While the quality of the book transcriptions is sufficiently high, our dataset will require a large amount of preprocessing in order to extract data of interest.
The fact that these books were written in different languages and some of them being extinct, such as old italian or old german, further complexifies the task. 

Nonetheless, we do want to stick to this problematic as it is a topic of great interest to us. As a group of experienced data scientists we will gladly tackle the extra challenge of the possibly cumbersome preprocessing.


## Problematic

The main axis we would like to develop is the overall travel routes taken through Italy over time, as well as the writer's perception of the visited locations in terms of valence and arousal. We would like to detect and emphasize common denominators which stay constant over time (and languages), and which factors may have changed, ideally even illustrating why these changes may have occurred.

Our main vision consists of creating a website targeted to travelers wanting to visit Italy in ancient times or enthusiasts who are interested about old travel routes in Italy. The main component of our page should consist of a landing page, allowing visitors to specify the time, locations in Italy they want to visit as well as languages they speak. In return, our page will provide them with travel guides of our dataset that may be of interest to them. While this component is more on the playful side, we intend to also show deeper insights gained from the analysis of our dataset, which reflect our main development axis. If we can effectively extract the travel routes of the guidebooks, we can also display them on an interactive map of Italy and one could select the time/language/location they want to show specific routes. In order to highlight similar aspects as well as differences in the testimonies of the travelers, clicking on them would make appear some additional data and statistics about the guides.

If we do not obtain sufficiently enough information from our dataset (or if we do and have enough time), we can merge it with another one about [Airbnb's in Italy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocrisafulli/airbnb-italy) from kaggle. We could then compare travelling back in the ancient times to current tourism.

Our main motivation for this is combining the current definition of travel guides with the perception of various travellers from different locations thoughout various time periods, and providing an insight into what travelling in Italy between the mid 16th century and early 20th century meant.

### Basic Book statistics



- There is a total of **78** distinct books.

- Page count per book:
  | Min | Max |  Mean   | Std_dev |
  | --- | --- |   ---   |   ---   |
  | 102 | 1250 | 383.86 | 193.15  |

- Word count per book:
  | Min  |   Max   |   Mean    |  Std_dev  |
  | ---  |   ---   |    ---    |    ---    |
  | 2103 | 3335171 | 466964.44 | 450411.14 |

- Languages featured:
    | Language    | Count |
    | ----------- | ----- |
    | English     | 37    |
    | French      | 16    |
    | German      | 11    |
    | Old Italian | 10    |
    | Latin       | 2     |
    | Dutch       | 1     |
    | Unknown     | 1     |


### Analysis of Book metadata


The language field provided by Transkribus seemed to be erroneous in most cases, which is why we checked the language of each transcribed book manually and corrected the corresponding fields.

![language distribution](./plots/language_distribution.png)

Almost half of the books we have are written in English, followed by French, German and Italian. Interestingly enough, two are in latin, one in Dutch and one that turned out to be in French after further research, although it was incorrectly transcribed by Transkribus, due to the author's handwriting being complicated to read.


![language distribution](./plots/location_distr.png)

We see that most books have been published in London, then Paris, which is in accordance with the fact that English is the most common language the guidebooks have been written in, followed by French.

The location of the guidebooks coincide well with the language in which they were published. There seems to be no location for Dutch, but there are some books in our dataset where the place of publication is unknown.

![language distribution](./plots/lang_yr.png)

The books have been written between 1550 and 1911. We have more books in the period between 1750 and 1870 and it is only from this period that the transcribed books are in English. There are mainly French authors around 1700-1710. The German books, though fewer than the English ones, were also written around 1800-1870. 




## Related Work

As far as the current director of the library of the Bibliotheca Hertziana knows, there has been no work done yet on the collection of travel guides for Italy. One of the former directors of the library, Ludwig Schudt, worked on the collection of early modern guide books for Rome and Italy. He published his long-term research, [_Italienreisen im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert_](https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/schudt1959?ui_lang=eng) (Travels to Italy of the 17th and 18th Centuries) in 1959.
Unfortunately for us, it is an art historical piece of work and not a quantitative data-driven study, so no such work seems to have been done with this kind of dataset yet. As of today there has thus been no work done to visualize the text and appearance of placenames and associated sentiment for travels in Italy, which makes the task even more intriguing and challenging. 

There is nonetheless a few works we could get inspiration from:

- [Atlas of early printing](http://atlas.lib.uiowa.edu/#): This is an interactive visualization of the early printing history in Europe. Specifically the trade routes are a nice reference to vizualise the travel routes.

- [The Mapping Colonial Americas Publishing Project](http://cds.library.brown.edu/mapping-genres/): This mapping of published books from the Brown library might give us ideas to visualize metadata about the books.
